c48294da-b441-4780-afb7-972e02bfa804,Preview: Pragmata Hacking Starts to Feel Natural,Siliconera,https://www.siliconera.com/preview-pragmata-hacking-starts-to-feel-natural/,"Sometimes, Capcom makes weird or unusual games! I’m talking about things even more unconventional than Mega Man Soccer. Like we’re talking Under the Skin sorts of weird with identity stealing or the Kabu Trader Shun stock market simulation game. While Pragmata is a third-person shooter, it also reminded me of those types of titles when I had the chance to play through a hands-on demo session. The puzzle-hacking element is unconventional and even odd, but starts to make sense after you get used to it. Hugh awakes on a lunar research station completely alone, surrounded by hostile enemies, and hoping to make contact with people back on Earth. The only person there is Diana, an Android that looks like a young girl and seems to consider some of the artificial lifeforms and robots her friends. The catch is that these mechanical beings see the duo as a threat and tend to attack on sight, and Hugh’s guns alone aren’t strong enough to defeat them. So while there is the third-person shooter element, you need to regularly use Diana’s hacking ability to strengthen shots and apply buffs. I got to play through an early snippet of Pragmata that felt like an opportunity to test out some of Diana’s in and out of battle hacking. The goal is to restore power to the station, and that means traversing some sections, using her ability to flip some switches to open a door, and facing a giant robot boss. While hacking to start the unlocking process, make platforms move, or reach areas is as easy as aiming in the right direction and pressing a button, the hacking for enemy fights is more involved. Admittedly, that did take some getting adjusted to, though I found I was okay with it by the time I reached the boss. On the upper right side of the screen, there will be a 4x4 grid with elements to highlight in certain directions, perhaps a power-up or buff that Hugh collected when exploring the world, maybe a blockade or two, and a green power symbol. Your goal is to go through the lines in the right direction to trigger the damage bonuses and get to the power sign so Diana can help Hugh deal real damage. My biggest issue honestly came from remembering that this is tied to the ABXY buttons. My brain kept thinking, “I’m moving up, left, right, and down, so I should be using the directional pad!” While this seems like a lot to consider, the hacking element with Diana in Pragmata takes so little time and offers such substantial bonuses that it begins to feel like second nature. You see an enemy? Quick go through the grid to power up while moving Hugh with the analog stick to evade any attacks. Once you get used to it, you could be through that in a few seconds. That carries over for a bit, and I found I’d head back to it when switching weapons or reloading to re-up the benefits. In the case of the boss fight, additional sub-weapons appeared around the area, so even taking advantage of Hugh moving to grab those while going through the hacking segment felt like a way of being efficient while preparing my next assault. Especially when it meant a defensive boost or allowing an attack to hit multiple foes instead of just one. The area of Pragmata I got to sample did feel like more of a tutorial segment, so it is entirely possible that Diana’s hacking could feel more challenging or taxing. But in this early slice of the game, it didn’t feel invasive or annoying. It made sense in the moment. Plus the buffs that came from it really air with survivability. It’s weird, but perhaps in a good way! I look forward to seeing more so I can properly decide. Pragmata will come to the Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC on April 24, 2026, and a demo is available. A Diana amiibo will also be released.

14b0cab2-96da-4e3f-b151-e27deec2f994,Yehey.com - University of Pennsylvania Cybersecurity Breach Investigation Concludes: Key Findings,Yehey,http://www.yehey.com/2026/02/yeheycom-university-of-pennsylvania.html,"Image courtesy by QUE. com The University of Pennsylvania (Penn) has announced that it has completed its investigation into a cybersecurity breach that occurred in October 2025. As with many incidents affecting large educational institutions, the case highlights how universities built to enable open collaboration are increasingly targeted by cybercriminals seeking personal data, research assets, and access to broader networks. While Penn has not framed the event as unique to higher education, the outcome of its investigation offers a timely reminder for students, faculty, staff, alumni, and partners: even well-resourced organizations can be vulnerable, and transparency, remediation, and prevention must move quickly after an attack. What Happened in the October 2025 Incident? According to Penn’s completion notice, the October 2025 event involved unauthorized access to certain university systems. In incidents like this, attackers often exploit a chain of weaknesses stolen credentials, misconfigurations, unpatched software, or phishing to move through environments that were never designed to resist modern threat actors. Why higher education is a prime target Universities present an attractive attack surface because they commonly maintain: Large user populations (students, faculty, staff, visiting researchers, contractors) Highly distributed IT environments with legacy systems and departmental autonomy Valuable research and intellectual property that may be monetized or exploited Personal and financial data tied to admissions, payroll, benefits, and donors The completion of Penn’s investigation signals that the university has likely performed forensic analysis to determine how access occurred, what systems were involved, what data may have been affected, and what steps are required to reduce the odds of recurrence. Key Findings: What an Investigation Typically Confirms When a major institution reports that an investigation is complete, that usually indicates several milestones have been reached. While each case differs, university breach investigations generally focus on a few core questions: Initial access: How did the attacker get in (phishing, stolen credentials, exploited vulnerability, third-party compromise)? Scope: Which systems, accounts, and network segments were reached? Data exposure: Was data viewed, copied, exfiltrated, altered, or deleted? Dwell time: How long the attacker had access before being detected and removed Persistence: Whether the attacker installed backdoors, created new accounts, or altered authentication settings Penn’s conclusion of its review suggests it has moved past initial containment and into the final phases of incident response notification, recovery, and longer-term security improvements. For those impacted, the most important question is usually simple: Was my information involved? That determination often guides whether affected individuals receive notice letters, identity protection services, or additional steps to secure their accounts. What Data Could Be at Risk in University Breaches? Even when institutions are careful about what they publish publicly, the reality is that universities hold a wide range of sensitive information. In similar breaches across higher education, potentially impacted data categories may include: Contact information such as names, addresses, email, phone numbers Identity-related data such as dates of birth or government identifiers Student records depending on system access (advising, enrollment, academic history) Employee HR and payroll data within administrative systems Donor and alumni data held in advancement and fundraising platforms It’s important to note that many investigations conclude that only a subset of systems were accessed, and that not every record in those systems was necessarily compromised. Still, cybersecurity experts typically advise that anyone connected to a breach-affected institution should treat the risk seriously even if they haven’t yet been individually notified. How Penn’s Response Fits the Standard Incident Response Lifecycle When a university states it has completed an investigation, it’s typically describing a structured process that includes: 1) Detection and containment Security teams first work to identify suspicious activity and stop it from continuing. Common steps include disabling compromised accounts, isolating affected servers, and tightening access controls. 2) Forensics and root-cause analysis Investigators reconstruct actions taken by the attacker, identify exploited paths, and confirm what was accessed. This stage often relies on log review, endpoint analysis, and network telemetry. 3) Eradication and recovery Once root cause is identified, teams remove malicious tools, reset credentials, patch vulnerabilities, restore systems, and validate that the threat actor no longer has access. 4) Notification and remediation Institutions evaluate applicable legal and regulatory requirements and determine who must be notified, what services should be offered, and what additional safeguards are needed going forward. The most meaningful part for the campus community is what comes next: durable changes that reduce risk, not just short-term cleanup. What Students, Faculty, and Staff Should Do Now Even if you have not received a direct notice, it is wise to take basic steps that reduce the likelihood of follow-on fraud like account takeover, phishing campaigns, or identity theft. Immediate actions to strengthen your security Change your password on university-linked accounts and any personal accounts that reused the same password Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) everywhere it’s available especially email and cloud storage Review account activity for unfamiliar logins, forwarding rules, or new recovery email/phone settings Watch for phishing messages referencing Penn, password resets, urgent IT alerts, or financial aid/payroll changes Consider a credit freeze if sensitive identifiers may have been exposed, depending on guidance in official notifications Signs of account compromise to look for Password reset emails you didn’t request Unexpected MFA prompts or authentication requests Email rules that auto-forward messages to unknown addresses New devices listed as trusted sign-in endpoints One of the most common post-breach risks is social engineering. Attackers may use stolen context names, departments, supervisors, recent campus events to craft realistic messages that trick recipients into sending money or providing access. What This Means for Higher Education Cybersecurity in 2026 The Penn breach investigation comes at a time when universities are actively modernizing security practices, but often face constraints that corporations may not: decentralized IT, large transient populations, and constant collaboration with third parties. To keep pace, many schools are adopting a more mature security posture, including: Zero Trust principles that verify users and devices continuously rather than assuming internal networks are safe Mandatory MFA for high-risk services and privileged accounts Endpoint detection and response (EDR) across faculty and staff devices Centralized logging and monitoring to reduce blind spots Stronger vendor risk management for third-party services tied to student and HR systems Regular tabletop exercises to improve response speed during real incidents For Penn and peer institutions, the long-term impact of a breach is measured not only by what happened in October 2025, but by how effectively the lessons learned translate into sustained improvements. Reputation, Trust, and Transparency After a Cyber Incident Universities depend on trust trust that tuition payments are processed securely, research is protected, and personal records are handled responsibly. Completing an investigation is a major step, but it is typically followed by continued communication to restore confidence. In many breach situations, the community looks for a few indicators of accountability: Clear, timely updates that explain what occurred without unnecessary technical jargon Direct guidance on how individuals can protect themselves Concrete security improvements rather than vague reassurances Support channels for questions, including dedicated help lines or web portals As the threat landscape evolves, transparency plays an increasingly important role in preventing secondary harm. When people understand what to look for phishing, fraud attempts, password reset scams they can better protect themselves and limit attacker success. Final Takeaway The University of Pennsylvania’s completion of its investigation into the October 2025 cybersecurity breach closes one chapter, but it also underscores how cybersecurity has become a constant operational priority for higher education. The most practical next step for the Penn community is to stay alert, strengthen account protections, and follow any official guidance related to notifications or identity monitoring. For universities everywhere, the bigger lesson is clear: modern threats require modern defenses strong authentication, rigorous monitoring, rapid response, and continuous improvement.

The suspects are Ahmad Bala, Karibu Mohammed Shehu, Umar Habib, Obinna Ananaba, Ibrahim Shehu, and Masa’ud Sa’ad. Hundeyin said operatives recovered two mini plazas, retail outlets containing over 400 laptops, 1,000 mobile phones, and a Toyota vehicle. The force spokesperson said a “substantial” amount of money was traced to the suspects’ bank accounts. “The syndicate was responsible for the illegal diversion of a telecommunications company’s airtime and data resources, resulting in an estimated financial loss of over ₦7.7 billion,” the statement reads. “The breakthrough followed a petition by a Nigerian telecommunications company, which reported suspicious and unauthorised activities within its billing and payments infrastructure. “Investigations revealed that internal staff login credentials had been compromised, granting threat actors unlawful access to core systems. “Following weeks of planning, coordinated enforcement operations were executed in October 2025 in Kano and Katsina States, with a follow-up arrest in the Federal Capital Territory. “The suspects would be charged to court on the completion of the investigation. “Meanwhile, the Inspector-General of Police, IGP Kayode Adeolu Egbetokun, Ph.D., NPM, has commended the officers involved in the investigation for their professionalism.”",2026-01-28T20:45:00.002000,False,False,False,False,True,False

Hundeyin said investigations are continuing to determine the full extent of the breach, trace any laundered proceeds, and identify possible accomplices. The suspects are expected to be charged under the Cybercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention, etc.) Act.

Notable Victims and Impact Black Basta has targeted over 500 organizations worldwide, with a heavy focus on the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. 11 Key sectors include: Healthcare: High-profile attacks on systems like Ascension (2024) disrupted patient care across multiple states. 12 Manufacturing & Industrial: The 2023 attack on Swiss industrial giant ABB highlighted their ability to hit global supply chains. 13 Critical Infrastructure: Their tendency to target energy and transportation led to a joint advisory by the FBI, CISA, and HHS. 14 4. Recent Developments (January 2026) While the group’s activity slowed significantly in 2025 following internal leaks, January 2026 has brought major law enforcement action: 15 Leader Unmasked: German and Ukrainian authorities identified Oleg Evgenievich Nefedov, a 35-year-old Russian national, as the alleged ringleader. 16 He has been added to the EU Most Wanted list and an INTERPOL Red Notice. 17+1 Arrests in Ukraine: In mid-January 2026, police raided residences in Ivano-Frankivsk and Lviv, arresting two ""hash crackers"" believed to be responsible for extracting credentials for the group. 18 The ""Cactus"" Migration: Despite the group's ""collapse,"" many former affiliates have reportedly migrated to other ransomware operations, most notably CACTUS, carrying over the same aggressive vishing tactics. 19 5. How to Defend Against Black Basta Defending against Black Basta requires a ""Defense in Depth"" strategy: Defense LayerRecommended ActionIdentityEnforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all external-facing services. VulnerabilityPrioritize patching for VPNs, Citrix, and Windows Active Directory. EndpointUse EDR/XDR solutions that detect behavioral anomalies, not just file signatures. Pro-Tip: Black Basta often deletes Volume Shadow Copies to prevent easy recovery. 20 Ensure your backups are ""immutable"" or stored off-site and offline to guarantee they cannot be encrypted during an attack.

DeadLock ransomware relies on Polygon smart contracts to spin proxy servers to produce a nearly unshuttable infrastructure. The ransomware threat exposed by cybersecurity firm Group-IB uses blockchain technology as an exploit. DeadLock relies on Polygon smart contracts to provide control over proxy servers by circumventing conventional security defenses. Group -IB has published a post on X stating that the ransomware uses Polygon smart contracts to spin proxy addresses. It is a low-profile, underreporting trick that is very effective in circumventing conventional security protocols. Blockchain Becomes Criminal Infrastructure DeadLock was released in July 2025 and maintained an unusually low profile. No public data-leak site, no affiliate program links, and the number of the victims was a limited one that ensured that exposure was minimal. The investigation by Group-IB revealed new tactics. Once a system has been encrypted, the ransomware probes special Polygon smart contracts containing the existing proxy addresses, allowing attackers and victims to communicate using these proxies. The blockchain solution has significant strengths: attackers can change proxy addresses in real-time, and thus do not have to re-deploy malware, leaving the defense teams with practically impossible take-down situations. Smart Contract Rotation Defies Detection Conventional command and control servers are prone to vulnerabilities that can be blocked by security agencies and confiscated by law enforcement agencies. DeadLock eradicates these weaknesses. Data is stored on‑chain. The information on the contracts is kept by distributed nodes across the globe, resulting in no central server, which can be shut down, and the infrastructure is exceptionally resilient. JavaScript code was found in HTML files by Group-IB. The code will query Polygon network smart contracts and auto-extract proxy URLs to send routing messages using those addresses to attackers.

Group-IB published its report on Jan. 15 and said the method could make disruption harder for defenders. The malware reads on-chain data, so victims do not pay gas fees. Researchers said Polygon is not vulnerable, but the tactic could spread. Ransomware groups usually rely on command-and-control servers to manage communications after breaking into a system. But security researchers now say a low-profile strain is using blockchain infrastructure in a way that could be harder to block. In a report published on Jan. 15, cybersecurity firm Group-IB said a ransomware operation known as DeadLock is abusing Polygon (POL) smart contracts to store and rotate proxy server addresses. These proxy servers are used to relay communication between attackers and victims after systems are infected. Because the information sits on-chain and can be updated anytime, researchers warned that this approach could make the group’s backend more resilient and tougher to disrupt. Smart contracts used to store proxy information Group-IB said DeadLock does not depend on the usual setup of fixed command-and-control servers. Instead, once a machine is compromised and encrypted, the ransomware queries a specific smart contract deployed on the Polygon network. That contract stores the latest proxy address that DeadLock uses to communicate. The proxy acts as a middle layer, helping attackers maintain contact without exposing their main infrastructure directly. Since the smart contract data is publicly readable, the malware can retrieve the details without sending any blockchain transactions. This also means victims do not need to pay gas fees or interact with wallets. DeadLock only reads the information, treating the blockchain as a persistent source of configuration data. Rotating infrastructure without malware updates One reason this method stands out is how quickly attackers can change their communication routes.

Security researchers say a low-profile ransomware group is using Polygon smart contracts to hide and rotate its command-and-control infrastructure. Summary DeadLock ransomware, first observed in July 2025, stores rotating proxy addresses inside Polygon smart contracts to evade takedowns. The technique relies only on reading on-chain data and does not exploit vulnerabilities in Polygon or other smart contracts. Researchers warn the method is cheap, decentralized, and difficult to block, even though the campaign has limited confirmed victims so far. Cybersecurity researchers are warning that a recently identified ransomware strain is using Polygon smart contracts in an unusual way that could make its infrastructure harder to disrupt. In a report published on Jan. 15, researchers at cybersecurity firm Group-IB said the ransomware, known as DeadLock, is abusing publicly readable smart contracts on the Polygon (POL) network to store and rotate proxy server addresses used to communicate with infected victims. DeadLock was first observed in July 2025 and has remained relatively low profile since then. Group-IB said the operation has a limited number of confirmed victims and is not linked to any known ransomware affiliate programs or public data leak sites. Despite its low visibility, the firm warned that the techniques being used are highly inventive and could pose serious risks if copied by more established groups. How the technique works Instead of relying on traditional command-and-control servers, which can often be blocked or taken offline, DeadLock embeds code that queries a specific Polygon smart contract after a system has been infected and encrypted.

DeadLock, a ransomware group that first emerged in July 2025, has made news again, and this time it is for abusing Polygon blockchain smart contracts to manage and rotate proxy server addresses, according to research published by cybersecurity firm Group-IB. The ransomware operation uses blockchain-based smart contracts to store the group’s proxy server URL, allowing frequent rotation that makes it difficult for defenders to permanently block infrastructure. After encrypting a victim’s systems, DeadLock drops an HTML file that acts as a wrapper for the decentralized messaging platform, Session. How does the DeadLock ransomware work on Polygon? Embedded JavaScript code within the file queries a specific Polygon smart contract to obtain the current proxy URL, which then relays encrypted messages between the victim and the attacker’s Session ID. These read-only blockchain calls generate no transactions or fees, making them cost-free for the attackers to maintain. Group-IB researchers noted that the exploit of smart contracts to deliver proxy addresses is an interesting method where attackers can apply infinite variants of this technique, with imagination being the only limit. The technique is not well documented and under-reported but its usage is gradually gaining traction in the wild, according to security researchers. Investigation by Cisco Talos revealed that DeadLock gains initial access by exploiting CVE-2024-51324, a Baidu Antivirus vulnerability, using a technique known as “bringing your own vulnerable driver” to terminate endpoint detection and response processes. DeadLock comes up with new extortion tactics DeadLock is different from most ransomware operations because it abandons the usual double extortion approach and does not have a data leak site where it could publicize attacks.

A recent spate of hacks has been keeping older decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms squarely in the crosshairs. During the 2020-2022 DeFi boom, the likes of Ribbon Finance, Rari Capital and Yearn were household names within the sector. However, contracts from all three projects were hacked in December, leading to speculation that blackhats may be reassessing forgotten code with the help of AI. The campaign apparently shows no signs of slowing down. A further two projects have now lost $27 million between them, over the course of three incidents. Truebit: $26M infinite mint On Thursday, “verification layer” Truebit suffered the year’s first major hack. The affected contract contained an integer-overflow vulnerability which allowed the hacker to mint a vast quantity of TRU tokens. These were then burned, the hacker withdrew 8, 535 ether (ETH) worth $26 million, and the TRU price plummeted to zero. Today, we became aware of a security incident involving one or more malicious actors. The affected smart contract is 0x764C64b2A09b09Acb100B80d8c505Aa6a0302EF2 and we strongly advise the public not to interact with this contract until further notice. We are in contact with law.- Truebit (@Truebitprotocol) January 8, 2026 Read more: Is an AI hacker targeting old DeFi projects in $5M spree? The code had been vulnerable since launch, almost five years ago. Given the contract once held almost 44, 000 ETH (worth $140 million), the damage could have been far worse. Afterward, on-chain bots replicated the attack, with one security researcher commenting that “fuzzing bots are eating this up like piranhas.” Futureswap: double trouble Earlier today, a second attack hit Futureswap, a seemingly-abandoned leverage trading platform on Arbitrum. As flagged by Decurity, the unverified contract lost just over $400,000, bringing the total extracted from the project to around $1 million in the past month.

635cf9d3-608d-4468-929b-9a8347baf721,Yehey.com - F5 Securities Lawsuit Exposes Cybersecurity Breach and Marketing Issues,Yehey,http://www.yehey.com/2026/01/yeheycom-f5-securities-lawsuit-exposes.html,"Image courtesy by QUE. com In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, cybersecurity has become an indispensable facet for businesses across the globe. Recent developments concerning F5 Securities have brought to light some pressing issues in the realm of cybersecurity marketing and breach challenges. This article delves into the intricacies of the F5 Securities lawsuit and the broader implications for the cybersecurity industry. Understanding the F5 Securities Lawsuit The F5 Securities lawsuit revolves around allegations that raise serious questions about the company’s security protocols and marketing claims. Allegedly, F5 underrepresented the potential vulnerabilities in their products and the extent of damage possible in the wake of a cyber breach. These allegations have brought cybersecurity marketing practices and breach responses into focus. The Core Allegations F5 Securities is accused of downplaying cybersecurity risks associated with their systems. The lawsuit claims that F5 misled stakeholders by overstating their security measures and the effectiveness of their technology solutions. It highlights a significant breach that reportedly compromised customer data and the subsequent response by the company. Insight into Cybersecurity Marketing Challenges Cybersecurity companies are often tasked with the dual responsibility of innovating protective solutions and communicating their effectiveness to clients. The pressures to maintain a competitive edge can sometimes lead to overzealous marketing strategies. These challenges are especially evident in the case of F5. Overpromising Leads to Under-Delivering In the competitive field of cybersecurity, the temptation to overpromise security features and solutions is strong. Many companies, in their rush to outpace competitors, make assertions about their products’ capabilities that might not hold up under scrutiny. This misrepresentation is a critical focus of the F5 lawsuit and underscores a recurring industry-wide dilemma. Navigating Customer Trust Establishing and maintaining customer trust is paramount for any business but becomes especially critical in cybersecurity. When companies like F5 face lawsuits questioning their integrity, it can erode trust, not just in their brand, but across the industry. Ensuring transparency and accountability in marketing communications can help mitigate this challenge. The Aftermath of Breaches: Challenges in Response and Recovery The implications of a cyber breach extend far beyond the initial incident, affecting both the company and its customers. The F5 lawsuit illustrates several challenges companies face after such breaches, particularly in their response and recovery efforts. Prompt and Adequate Response Speedy detection and response are critical in minimizing the impact of a data breach. Inadequate response times can lead to heightened consequences, causing long-term reputational and financial damage. F5 is criticized for its initial response to the breach, highlighting a need for better incident management protocols. Restoring Customer Confidence Another hurdle following a breach is the process of restoring customer confidence. Companies must engage in open communication and demonstrate that they have taken significant steps to enhance their security measures. Fostering transparency about the steps taken post-breach can help in regaining client trust. Broader Industry Implications The fallout from the F5 Securities lawsuit extends beyond the company itself, heralding potential shifts in how cybersecurity firms operate and market themselves. Here are some considerations for the industry at large: Re-evaluating Marketing Strategies The necessity for accuracy in marketing is paramount. Companies need to align their promotional messages closely with the actual capabilities of their products. This alignment can help prevent misleading claims and subsequent legal troubles, as witnessed by F5. A focus on factual and performance-based marketing could enhance credibility and trust. Investing in Enhanced Security Measures Breaches underscore the need for ongoing investment in advanced security technologies and protocols. Cybersecurity firms must remain committed to continuous improvement in their offerings, ensuring that they can defend against ever-evolving cyber threats. Continuous innovation and commitment to rigorous testing will be essential to maintain a competitive advantage and mitigate risks. Emphasis on Regulatory Compliance Regulatory landscapes around data protection and cybersecurity are becoming more stringent. Ensuring compliance with all relevant standards can safeguard companies against potential lawsuits and penalties. Adhering to a sound compliance framework can reinforce trust in the company's commitment to security as a priority. Conclusion The F5 Securities lawsuit has cast a spotlight on some of the most pressing challenges faced by the cybersecurity industry today. As businesses become increasingly reliant on digital infrastructures, the need for reliable, transparent, and effective cybersecurity solutions is more crucial than ever. Companies must navigate the delicate balance between innovative marketing and truthful representation of their capabilities, alongside a robust and responsive approach to breach management. For the industry to move forward, it is imperative that lessons are learned from these legal challenges and breaches, pushing for greater accountability, transparency, and dedication to technological advancement.

Users have reported receiving multiple password reset request emails following the alleged hack reported by Malwarebytes. However, Meta continues to insist that there was no breach. Was Instagram’s user data leaked? Malwarebytes reported that Instagram discovered a breach in its security during a routine dark web monitoring scan. And it claims that it has resulted in the sensitive data of approximately 17. 5 million Instagram users being made available for sale on underground forums so far. The compromised information includes Instagram usernames, physical addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and additional personal details. The cybersecurity company said this incident is linked to a potential API exposure that occurred in 2024.

There was no breach of our systems and your Instagram accounts are secure. You can ignore those emails sorry for any confusion,” the company wrote. Despite Meta’s denial, many Instagram users have reported receiving multiple password reset request emails in recent days, and panic has spread on social media that cybercriminals are attempting to exploit people’s stolen information.

The company added that the ""data is available for sale on the dark web and can be abused by cybercriminals."" Malwarebytes noted in an email to its customers that it discovered the breach during its routine dark web scan and that it's tied to a potential incident related to an Instagram API exposure from 2024.

Key Points: Former French tax official leaked cryptocurrency holder data. Data breach raises security concerns for crypto holders. Highlight risk of insider abuse in tax systems. A former French tax official, Ghalia C., has been accused of leaking cryptocurrency investors’ data, sparking concerns over security risks associated with confidential tax information. The event underscores potential security vulnerabilities faced by cryptocurrency investors, emphasizing the importance of data protection amid increasing regulatory scrutiny in Europe. French Crypto Holders at Risk Amid Data Breach Scandal Ghalia C., a former French tax agent, was sentenced for alleged abuse of access to confidential tax databases, leaking data on cryptocurrency holders. Reports indicated she collected details on investors, including their location and capital gains. Though no actual attacks were planned based on the leaked data, the situation spotlights potential vulnerabilities within tax systems, particularly as European tax authorities intensify their scrutiny of cryptocurrency assets. The increased risk of insider breaches could pose heightened security threats to crypto holders, making them targets for potential physical attacks. As authorities expand their monitoring capabilities, securing confidential taxpayer information becomes increasingly critical. Despite the serious implications, there has been a lack of official response from major crypto leaders or French authorities. Ledger’s customer data breach reported globally also highlights such vulnerabilities, where identities linked with holdings have been targeted. Current market reactions appear limited, with no clear institutional or technological changes linked directly to this case. However, the event could lead to stronger policies on data protection and monitoring practices. Potential Policy Shifts and Market Stability Concerns Did you know? The 2020 Ledger data breach also highlighted the vulnerability of linking identities with crypto holdings, leading to phishing attacks and security concerns among crypto users.

Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As renewed scrutiny around JPMorgan Chase’s data security incident unsettles markets, crypto investors are shifting focus toward asset protection and security-first on-chain solutions. Summary Reports tied to traditional finance security risks are prompting some BTC and XRP holders to reassess centralized custody and single-institution exposure. Platforms emphasizing smart-contract automation, auditing, insurance coverage, and real-time risk monitoring are attracting increased investor attention. In a volatile outlook toward 2026, structured yield models and security-focused cloud mining solutions like IO DeFi are becoming part of longer-term allocation strategies. Recently, the market has focused on reports regarding the data security incident at JPMorgan Chase. While the specific impact is still being verified, the news has already sparked discussion in the market and influenced the sentiment of some investors. In major US financial centers, some XRP and Bitcoin (BTC) holders are beginning to re-evaluate their asset allocation, shifting their focus from short-term price fluctuations to asset security and risk diversification. Market observations suggest that when data security issues within the traditional financial system become a focal point of discussion, investors tend to be more wary of relying on single institutions or centralized custody models. This market reaction is influencing the risk assessment and allocation strategies of some digital asset holders. Security and stability become the focus, on-chain solutions receive more attention Amid repeated discussions about security and long-term stability, some investors are beginning to turn their attention to on-chain platforms with mature risk control systems. Taking IO DeFi as an example, it automates asset management processes through smart contracts and combines on-chain automated returns with cloud mining participation models to attempt to provide a relatively stable and controllable return structure during periods of market…",2026-01-09T08:07:16,False,False,True,False,False,False

The bold action was applauded across social media. The stunt took place during a talk at Germany’s Chaos Communication Congress. The hacker, who goes by the pseudonym Martha Root, deleted the servers for WhiteDate, WhiteChild, and WhiteDeal in real time while the audience watched. A live demo erased white supremacist platforms Root shared the stage with journalists Eva Hoffmann and Christian Fuchs, who reported on the websites for the German weekly newspaper Die Zeit. According to their report, WhiteDate was described as ""Tinder for Nazis."" WhiteChild claimed to match white sperm and egg donors. WhiteDeal, meanwhile, the report stated, resembled a freelance labor marketplace for racists. At the end of the talk, Root remotely deleted the sites’ servers, which took very little time due to the lack of cybersecurity on the sites. media. ccc. de/YouTube The administrator of all three sites quickly confirmed the hack on X, where they wrote, ""They publicly delete all my websites while the audience rejoices. This is cyberterrorism. No wonder some of them hide their faces. But we will find them, and trust me, there will be repercussions."" Root later published data allegedly scraped from WhiteDate, which she said showed ""poor cybersecurity hygiene that would make even your grandma’s AOL account blush."" The leaked material included profiles with names, photos, ages, and locations. It also listed gender, language, race, and user descriptions. ""Imagine calling yourselves the 'master race' but forgetting to secure your own website,"" Root wrote. ""Maybe try mastering to host WordPress before world domination."" media. ccc. de/YouTube Online reactions praised the Pink Ranger hacker People online were fascinated by the news of the hacker. X user @shadowyartsdirt wrote, ""Hacking for good, while dressed as a ranger is peak."" Meanwhile, @enzoberranzan praised Root’s phrasing, saying, ""'Maybe try mastering to host WordPress before world domination' is one of the hardest lines I've ever heard."" X user @the1ahorner framed Root as ""the real hero we need for 2026."" @TracketPacer added that deleting the site's ""live onstage while dressed as the pink power ranger has got to be one of the most cathartic hacker experiences."" Some leaned into the nostalgia of Root's costume. ""I feel like this is what the Power Rangers would be doing if they didn't have to deal with like witches biofreaks and clay monsters from space,"" @dare908 mused. Finally, @atograisse tweeted, ""It's always nice to see ethical hacking, aka CYBER SECURITY in action. Sad it has to be secretive despite the collective good its doing.""

The recent developments surrounding the European Space Agency (ESA) highlight the pressing need for robust cybersecurity measures. As the ESA faces potential breaches, concerns about the integrity and safety of European space data and operations grow exponentially. The Recent Threat Landscape This isn't the first time a major institution has faced potential breaches. However, when such incidents involve an agency like the ESA, the stakes are incredibly high. With millions of data points and mission-critical operations, a breach could compromise everything from satellite data to international collaborations. Why The ESA is a Prime Target The European Space Agency manages numerous missions that are crucial to international aerospace efforts. Here are a few reasons why organizations like the ESA are prime targets for cyberattacks: High Value Data: Space missions rely on intricate data, making this information invaluable for competitors or adversaries. Global Influence: As a major player in the global space community, ESA holds strategic importance. Complex Infrastructure: The multifaceted technological setups create wider attack surfaces for potential hackers. Implications of a Potential Breach Understanding the impact of a cybersecurity breach on the ESA requires a deep dive into its operations and the wider aerospace community. Operational Disruptions Halted Missions: A breach could lead to delays or cancellations of missions, affecting international timelines and collaborations. Data Integrity: Any compromise of data can mislead or misinform, causing catastrophic errors in space missions. Economic Impact Space missions are not only scientifically crucial but economically significant. A breach in security could cause: Financial Losses: Delayed launches or compromised missions lead to increased costs and potential financial penalties. Decreased Investor Confidence: Trust is critical in aerospace. Breaches can lead investors to pull back on funding. Safeguarding Space Infrastructure With growing threats, proactive measures are paramount. Addressing potential cybersecurity pitfalls involves both technological solutions and strategic planning. Technological Defenses Adapting to modern threats means strengthening existing infrastructures. Here’s how: Advanced Encryption: Ensures that data, whether in transit or storage, remains inaccessible to unauthorized parties. Regular Security Audits: Spot vulnerabilities and address them before they become actual threats. Real-time Monitoring Systems: Immediate detection of threats can thwart major breaches. Human Element in Security Technology alone can’t bridge the gap. Human expertise remains a crucial element: Continuous Training: Regularly update staff on the latest threats and best practices to mitigate them. Dedicated Response Teams: Empower teams that are specifically trained to handle potential breaches swiftly. Collaborations and Global Efforts A robust defense framework not only involves internal efforts but also collaborations with global partners: International Cooperations The ESA is not alone. Space agencies worldwide face similar threats, making international cooperation vital. Shared Resources: Knowledge and technology sharing can effectively strengthen collective defenses. Joint Drills: Regular collaborative exercises can prepare teams for actual cyber threat scenarios. Public-Private Partnerships Modern cyber threats require not only government intervention but also private sector expertise: Cutting-edge Technology: Private enterprises often lead with innovative solutions that can be leveraged by the ESA. Funding and Resources: Collaborations with tech firms can provide additional resources focused on cyber defense. Conclusion As the world becomes increasingly digital, cybersecurity remains at the forefront of effective space mission planning. The European Space Agency's potential breach serves as a cautionary tale about the pressing needs for enhanced cybersecurity measures. Through technological innovations, human expertise, and global collaborations, the aerospace community can arm itself against these evolving threats and ensure that space endeavors continue uninterrupted.

The incident marks another security concern for the French crypto company, which has faced multiple data exposure events since 2020. How the Breach Happened Global-e, a cross-border e-commerce platform that handles international transactions and payment processing for major brands worldwide, detected unusual activity in its cloud systems. The company immediately implemented containment measures and hired independent forensic experts to investigate the unauthorized access. The breach came to public attention when blockchain investigator ZachXBT shared customer notification emails on social media. Affected Ledger customers received direct communications from Global-e explaining the incident. According to Ledger’s statement, the unauthorized party gained access to order data stored in Global-e’s information systems. Only customers who made purchases on Ledger. com using Global-e as the merchant of record were potentially impacted. What Information Was Exposed The compromised data includes customer names and contact information. However, the exact types of contact details-whether email addresses, phone numbers, or physical addresses-have not been fully specified by either company. Importantly, several critical types of information were not compromised. Payment details such as credit card numbers and bank account information remained secure. The breach did not affect wallet recovery phrases, private keys, blockchain balances, or any cryptocurrency holdings. Ledger emphasized that its own hardware, software, and platform systems were not breached. As a self-custodial wallet provider, Global-e never had access to users’ 24-word seed phrases or digital assets. No customer funds are at risk from this incident. Global-e confirmed that Ledger was not the only brand impacted by the breach, stating that the attacker accessed order data from multiple retailers.

Development teams often face hundreds or thousands of findings from security scanners, making it challenging to identify which vulnerabilities pose the greatest risk and should be prioritized. This is where effective vulnerability triaging becomes essential. In this article, we'll explore how GitLab's integrated security scanning capabilities combined with the GitLab Duo Security Analyst Agent can transform vulnerability management from a time-consuming manual process into an intelligent, efficient workflow.💡 Join GitLab Transcend on February 10 to learn how agentic AI transforms software delivery. Hear from customers and discover how to jumpstart your own modernization journey. Register now. What is vulnerability triaging? Vulnerability triaging is the process of analyzing, prioritizing, and deciding how to address security findings discovered in your applications. Not all vulnerabilities are created equal some represent critical risks requiring immediate attention, while others may be false positives or pose minimal threat in your specific context. Traditional triaging involves: Reviewing scan results from multiple security toolsAssessing severity based on CVSS scores and exploitabilityUnderstanding context such as whether vulnerable code is actually reachablePrioritizing remediation based on business impact and riskTracking resolution through to deploymentThis process becomes overwhelming when dealing with large codebases and frequent scans. GitLab addresses these challenges through integrated security scanning and AI-powered analysis. How to add integrated security scanners in GitLabGitLab provides built-in security scanners that integrate seamlessly into your CI/CD pipelines. These scanners run automatically during pipeline execution and populate GitLab's Vulnerability Report with findings from the default branch. Available security scannersGitLab offers the following security scanning capabilities: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Analyzes source code for vulnerabilitiesDependency Scanning: Identifies vulnerabilities in project dependenciesContainer Scanning: Scans Docker images for known vulnerabilitiesDynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Tests running applications for vulnerabilitiesSecret Detection: Finds accidentally committed secrets and credentialsInfrastructure-as-Code (IaC) Scanning: Analyzes infrastructure as code for misconfigurationsAPI Security Testing: Test web APIs to help discover bugs and potential security issuesWeb API Fuzzing: Passes unexpected values to API operation parameters to cause unexpected behavior and errors in the backendExample: Adding SAST and Dependency ScanningTo enable security scanning, add the scanners to your . gitlab-ci. yml file. In this example, we are including SAST and Dependency Scanning templates which automatically run those scanners on the test stage. Each scanner can be overwritten using variables (which differ for each scanner). For example, the SAST_EXCLUDED_PATHS variable tells SAST to skip the directories/files provided. Security jobs can be further overwritten using the GitLab Job Syntax. include: template: Security/SAST. gitlab-ci. yml template: Security/Dependency-Scanning. gitlab-ci. yml stages: test variables: SAST_EXCLUDED_PATHS: ""spec/, test/, tests/, tmp/"" Example: Adding Container ScanningGitLab provides a built-in container registry where you can store container images for each GitLab project. To scan those containers for vulnerabilities, you can enable container scanning. This example shows how a container is built and pushed in the build-container job running in the build stage and how it is then scanned in the same pipeline in the test stage: include: template: Security/Container-Scanning. gitlab-ci. yml stages: build test build-container: stage: build variables: IMAGE: I_REGISTRY_IMAGE/I_COMMIT_REF_SLUG: I_COMMIT_SHA before_script: docker login -u I_REGISTRY_USER -p I_REGISTRY_PASSWORD I_REGISTRY script: docker build -t MAGE - docker push MAGE container_scanning: variables: CS_IMAGE: I_REGISTRY_IMAGE/I_COMMIT_REF_SLUG: I_COMMIT_SHA Once configured, these scanners execute automatically in your pipeline and report findings to the Vulnerability Report. Note: Although not covered in this blog, in merge requests, scanners show the diff of vulnerabilities from a feature branch to the target branch. Additionally, granular security policies can be created to prevent vulnerable code from being merged (without approval) if vulnerabilities are detected, as well as force scanners to run, regardless of how the . gitlab-ci. yml is defined. Triaging using the Vulnerability Report and PagesAfter scanners run, GitLab aggregates all findings in centralized views that make triaging more manageable.

This page displays all discovered vulnerabilities with key information: Severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info)Status (Detected, Confirmed, Dismissed, Resolved)Scanner type that detected the vulnerabilityAffected files and lines of codeDetection date and pipeline informationFiltering and organizing vulnerabilitiesThe Vulnerability Report provides powerful filtering options: Filter by severity, status, scanner, identifier, and reachabilityGroup by severity, status, scanner, OWASP Top 10Search for specific CVEs or vulnerability namesSort by detection date or severityView trends over time with the security dashboardManual workflow triageTraditional triaging in GitLab involves: Reviewing each vulnerability by clicking into the detail pageAssessing the description and understand the potential impactExamining the affected code through integrated linksChecking for existing fixes or patches in dependenciesSetting status (Confirm, Dismiss with reason, or create an issue)Assigning ownership for remediationThis is an example of vulnerability data provided to allow for triage including the code flow: When on the vulnerability data page, you can select Edit vulnerability to change its status as well as provide a reason. Then you can create an issue and assign ownership for remediation. While this workflow is comprehensive, it requires security expertise and can be time-consuming when dealing with hundreds of findings. This is where GitLab Duo Security Analyst Agent, part of GitLab Duo Agent Platform, becomes invaluable. About Security Analyst Agent and how to set it upGitLab Duo Security Analyst Agent is an AI-powered tool that automates vulnerability analysis and triaging. The agent understands your application context, evaluates risk intelligently, and provides actionable recommendations. What Security Analyst Agent doesThe agent analyzes vulnerabilities by: Evaluating exploitability in your specific codebase contextAssessing reachability to determine if vulnerable code paths are actually usedPrioritizing based on risk rather than just CVSS scoresExplaining vulnerabilities in clear, actionable languageRecommending remediation steps specific to your applicationReducing false positives through contextual analysisPrerequisitesTo use Security Analyst Agent, you need: GitLab Ultimate subscription with GitLab Duo Agent Platform enabledSecurity scanners configured in your projectAt least one vulnerability in your Vulnerability ReportEnabling Security Analyst AgentSecurity Analyst Agent is a foundational agent. Unlike the general-purpose GitLab Duo agent, foundational agents understand the unique workflows, frameworks, and best practices of their specialized domains. Foundational agents can be accessed directly from your project without any additional configuration.

From the chat, select the model to use with the agent and make sure to enable Agentic mode. A chat will open where you can engage with Security Analyst Agent by using the agent's conversational interface. This agent can perform: Vulnerability triage: Analyze and prioritize security findings across different scan types. Risk assessment: Evaluate the severity, exploitability, and business impact of vulnerabilities. False positive identification: Distinguish genuine threats from benign findings. Compliance management: Understand regulatory requirements and remediation timelines. Security reporting: Generate summaries of security posture and remediation progress. Remediation planning: Create actionable plans to address security vulnerabilities. Security workflow automation: Streamline repetitive security assessment tasks. Additionally, these are the tools which Security Analyst Agent has at its disposal: For example, I can ask ""What are the most critical vulnerabilities and which vulnerabilities should I address first?"" to make it easy to determine what is important. The agent will respond as follows: Example queries for effective triagingHere are powerful queries to use with the Security Analyst Agent: Identify critical issues:""Show me vulnerabilities that are actively exploitable in our production code"" Focus on reachable vulnerabilities:""Which high-severity vulnerabilities are in code paths that are actually executed?"" Understand dependencies:""What are the most critical dependency vulnerabilities and are patches available?"" Get remediation guidance:""Explain how to fix the SQL injection vulnerability in user authentication"" You can also directly assign developers to vulnerabilities. Understanding agent recommendationsWhen Security Analyst Agent analyzes vulnerabilities, it provides: Risk assessment: The agent explains why a vulnerability is critical beyond just the CVSS score, considering your application's specific architecture and usage patterns. Exploitability analysis: It determines whether vulnerable code is actually reachable and exploitable in your environment, helping filter out theoretical risks. Remediation steps: The agent provides specific, actionable guidance on how to fix vulnerabilities, including code examples when appropriate. Priority ranking: Instead of overwhelming you with hundreds of findings, the agent helps identify the top issues that should be addressed first. Real-world workflow exampleHere's how a typical triaging session might look: Start with the big picture: ""Analyze the security posture of this project and highlight the top 5 most critical vulnerabilities.""Dive into specifics: For each critical vulnerability identified, ask ""Is this vulnerability actually exploitable in our application?""Plan remediation: ""What's the recommended fix for this SQL injection issue, and are there any side effects to consider?""Track progress: After addressing critical issues, ask ""What vulnerabilities should I prioritize next?""Benefits of agent-assisted triagingUsing Security Analyst Agent transforms vulnerability management: Time savings: Reduce hours of manual analysis to minutes of guided reviewBetter prioritization: Focus on vulnerabilities that actually pose risk to your specific applicationKnowledge transfer: Learn security best practices through agent explanationsConsistent standards: Apply consistent triaging logic across all projectsReduced alert fatigue: Filter noise and false positives effectivelyGet started todayVulnerability triaging doesn't have to be an overwhelming manual process.

In brief Global-e, Ledger’s e-commerce partner, experienced unauthorized access to order data systems affecting some Ledger. com customers. No crypto assets, security phrases, blockchain balances, or payment information were compromised in the breach. Ledger has hired independent forensic experts to investigate the incident at the third-party platform. Crypto wallet maker Ledger confirmed that its Global-e e-commerce partner has suffered a data breach, but cautioned users that its own hardware and software wallets remain secure. Ledger, which is based in Paris, has been making and selling crypto wallets for 12 years. The company has sold more than 7. 5 million devices, and estimates that its hardware and software are being used to custody approximately 20% of the world’s crypto assets. “This incident consisted of unauthorized access to order data in Global-e information systems. Some of the data accessed as part of this incident pertained to customers who made a purchase on Ledger. com using Global-e as a merchant of record,” a Ledger spokesperson told Decrypt in an emailed statement. Global-e is a global e-commerce and payment platform that helps brands sell their products internationally. It’s headquartered in Israel and trades on the Nasdaq under the GLBE ticker. It’s used by hundreds of other retailers, including Victoria’s Secret, Adidas, Alo Yoga, and Marc Jacobs. The statement added that because Ledger products are self-custodial, Global-e does not have access to customer information like 24-word security phrases, crypto balances, or any other private info related to digital assets. “Importantly, no payment information was involved,” the company added. ﻿ Ledger also said in a statement sent to its users that it has retained “independent forensic experts to conduct an investigation into the incident.” This is the latest in a string of security-related alerts connected to third-party systems linked to Ledger and its devices, which include the Stax and.",2026-01-05T22:02:13,False,False,True,False,False,False

A new security incident at Strategy’s commerce partner has reignited the debate over Ledger data breach risks and long‑term exposure for crypto customers worldwide. New Global data breach exposes Ledger customer information On January 5, 2026, blockchain researcher ZachXBT revealed that personal information belonging to Ledger customers had been accessed in a hack affecting payment processor Global‑e. According to the findings, attackers obtained customer names and contact details through vulnerabilities in Global‑e’s infrastructure. However, the company emphasized that no wallet balances, private keys, or recovery phrases were touched. Global‑e said it detected suspicious activity in part of its cloud environment and moved quickly to lock down affected systems, bringing in external forensic investigators to assess the intrusion. Moreover, there has been no indication so far that payment card numbers or account passwords were exposed. Ledger reiterated in a customer email that the incident occurred at the level of a third‑party provider, stressing that the core security of its hardware wallets and offline asset storage remains intact. Heightened phishing and social engineering risks While customer funds remain safe on hardware wallets, security researchers and community members warned that the new exposure greatly increases the odds of phishing and social engineering attempts. Attackers who possess verified names and contact details can craft highly targeted, convincing messages that appear to come from legitimate support channels. That said, investigators do not see a direct technical link between this incident and earlier hacks in the ecosystem. Nevertheless, the clustering of breaches across crypto service providers in recent years has significantly deepened user anxiety about customer privacy and safety, as data once leaked can circulate indefinitely. This latest ledger data breach reference comes in a context where identity‑based attacks against crypto holders are steadily rising.

Hardware wallet giant Ledger confirmed a network breach on Monday after unauthorized access occurred within systems operated by an external payment provider. The incident may have exposed limited customer order information. Ledger stressed that wallets, devices, and recovery phrases remained secure and unaffected. The Ledger breach originated from infrastructure used to process payments and manage online orders. The platform identified the issue after suspicious activity appeared in a cloud-based environment linked to its commerce operations. Access to the affected systems was blocked once the activity was detected. Ledger Breach Limited Data Exposure, Wallets Unaffected In an X post, ZachXBT shared an email alert sent to customers by Global-e regarding the incident.

The crypto community and security researchers foresee an incoming spike of phishing attacks. Ledger’s partner Global-e hit by data leak, exposes customer contact information Ledger, a provider of hardware cryptocurrency wallets, registered a massive data incident today, Jan. 5, 2026. The personal information of its clients was leaked by Global-e, a vendor of payment processing solutions in Ledger’s ecosystem. So far, only names and contact information were reported as leaked. No signs of potential seed phrases or passwords being compromised or funds stolen have appeared so far. At the same time, such an attack unlocks massive opportunities for phishing campaigns. Now, when real names and contact details of Ledger users are exposed, malefactors can start sending emails with malicious links or social engineering attempts. As such, security researchers recommend to avoid opening any emails pretending to be authored by the Ledger team, in particular those with requests to “reset passwords.” No legitimate platform would ask for seed phrases, private keys, passwords or other personal information.

Key Takeaways: Ledger confirmed a customer data exposure tied to its third-party payment processor, Global-e. Leaked information includes names and contact details; no wallet seeds, private keys, or crypto funds were compromised. The incident was first flagged publicly by blockchain investigator ZachXBT, prompting customer notifications and an ongoing forensic review. Ledger users received an alert after Global-e detected unauthorized access within parts of its cloud systems. The disclosure renews scrutiny on third-party risk in crypto commerce, even when core wallet infrastructure remains intact. What Happened: Third-Party Exposure, Not a Wallet Hack Ledger disclosed that the incident occurred outside its own hardware, software, and platform environment. The breach traces back to Global-e, which serves as a merchant-of-record and payment processor for Ledger’s online store. According to the notification sent to customers, Global-e identified unusual activity and quickly implemented controls. An independent forensic investigation later confirmed that some customer order data was improperly accessed. The exposed fields include names and other contact information, while payment details were not involved. Ledger emphasized a critical point for users: Global-e does not have access to recovery phrases, private keys, balances, or any secrets tied to self-custodied assets. As a result, the exposure does not affect the cryptographic security of Ledger devices. What Data Was Exposed and What Was Not There should be a distinct line in such incidents. The facts are available to show a data privacy incident, but not a crypto compromise. Exposed Customer names Contact details associated with orders (such as email or shipping information) Not exposed Recovery phrases (24 words) Private keys or wallet secrets On-chain balances or transaction signing Payment card data This identification restricts the exposure to direct financial risk, although the possibility of targeted phishing is greater.

Ledger’s social media channels show no active incidents, urging vigilance yet. In an email response to CoinDesk, Ledger emphasized that the breach occurred at Global-e, adding that the payment processor sent the email notification to customers because it is the data controller. “Ledger was made aware of an incident at Global-e, an e-commerce partner for global brands and retailers, including Ledger,” the company told CoinDesk. “This incident consisted of unauthorized access to order data in Global-e information systems. Some of the data accessed as part of this incident pertained to customers who made a purchase on Ledger. com using Global-e as a Merchant of Record. “This was not a breach of Ledger’s platform, hardware or software systems, which remain secure.

Crime Hardware wallet maker Ledger is once again dealing with the fallout from a customer data exposure-this time stemming from a breach at one of its external service providers rather than its own systems. The company confirmed that its payment processor, Global-e, detected suspicious activity within part of its cloud infrastructure and moved to shut down affected systems. The incident was disclosed to customers on January 5, 2026, after an internal review and the involvement of independent forensic investigators. Key Takeaways The breach originated from Ledger’s third-party payment processor, not Ledger’s core systems. Customer names and contact information were exposed, but no wallets or funds were affected. Ledger has not disclosed how many users were impacted or the full scope of leaked data. The incident highlights ongoing risks tied to external vendors in the crypto industry. What was exposed and what wasn’t According to notifications sent to affected users, the breach resulted in unauthorized access to limited personal information, specifically names and contact details. Ledger emphasized that no cryptographic material was compromised: private keys, recovery phrases, wallet firmware, and on-chain funds remain secure. However, the company did not disclose how many customers were impacted or precisely which types of contact information were accessed, such as email addresses, phone numbers, or physical locations. That lack of detail has raised concern among some users, particularly given Ledger’s past experiences with data leaks. A pattern of third-party risk This marks the second known incident in which Ledger customers have been affected by unauthorized data access since 2025, reinforcing a recurring theme in the crypto industry: while self-custody tools may be technically secure, the surrounding ecosystem of vendors can still introduce vulnerabilities.

Attackers connect their own device to the victim’s WhatsApp account and, therefore, monitor the victim’s conversations without the victim's knowledge. As more and more people in India are becoming increasingly reliant on this new Linked Devices feature, the risk of being attacked continues to grow. Users can still be using WhatsApp normally while, at the same time, a hacker is reading every word of their private conversations. What's this ghost pairing scam in WhatsApp all about? Ghost Pairing is an insidious WhatsApp hack that scammers are using to exploit the service's linking system for nefarious goals. The tricksters convince victims into letting them pair a mystery device to their WhatsApp account simply by having their mobile number. There isn't even an OTP request or a password prompt, let alone having to swap SIM cards. So many victims later end up searching online, asking if it's really possible to hack WhatsApp without needing a one-time password. Once the scammer gets paired, they get to keep slogging through your chats, media, and contacts. Why CERT Is Warning People The CERT advisory makes it clear that scammers are taking advantage of WhatsApp's multi-device feature to gain sneaky access. The agency calls it a high-risk threat, warning that people may not immediately notice anything off. Linked devices are supposed to run quietly in the background, which is kind of what's so sneaky about these scams; it lets the scammer keep tabs for a long time, upping the risk for financial scams and identity theft. How the WhatsApp Ghost Pairing Con Works The scam usually starts off with what looks like a message from someone you know. Victims get a photo or video sent to them, or a link with instant language such as “Is that you?” or “Quickly check this out.” Clicking on the content takes users to a fake WhatsApp pairing or verification page that looks like the real deal. That's where the scammer gets to link their device, usually without setting off any alarms. What hackers can do after a device is linked to your account Once you've successfully paired a device with your WhatsApp using Ghost Pairing, hackers can get their hands on your personal and group chats, swoop in and grab any files that have been shared, and even pretend to be you to target your friends and contacts. For a lot of users it doesn't even dawn on them that something is amiss until a friend comes to them freaking out about suspicious messages. This is why this scam is spreading fast; it's turning up on people's searches with terms like ""WhatsApp hacked"" and ""Is my WhatsApp account being monitored?"" What to do if you think your WhatsApp has been hacked If you suddenly start to get the feeling that something fishy is going on with your account, check out Settings -> Linked Devices right away. See what devices are linked up & remove any that look unfamiliar. It's a good idea to turn that two-step verification on, change the PIN, and then log back in securely. If you still can't get access back, it's best to let the authorities know, so head on over to cybercrime. gov. in and file a report, or give the national cybercrime hotline 1930 a call. That's what the Indian cyber authorities recommend. How to keep yourself safe from WhatsApp scams The experts are in agreement: be super careful when clicking on links or media that come in unsolicited, even from people you know. And never scan a QR code unless you're the one who initiated the action; it's a big no-no to do otherwise. And one more thing, make a habit of going over your WhatsApp privacy and linked-device settings on a regular basis. Common sense and staying on your toes are still the best defense against those sneaky social engineering attacks.

The compensation plan comes a day after Coupang founder Kim Bom-suk issued his first public apology since the incident, which affected nearly two-thirds of South Korea's population, reports Yonhap news agency. Under the plan, the U. S.-listed company will provide 50, 000 won worth of discounts and coupons to each of 33. 7 million customers, including paid Coupang Wow members, regular users and former customers who have closed their accounts, the company said in a press release.

The per-person compensation consists of 5, 000 won for Coupang's e-commerce platform, 5, 000 won for food delivery service Coupang Eats, 20, 000 won for Coupang's travel products and 20, 000 won for R.

Last week, Coupang said it had identified a former employee responsible for the data leak through forensic evidence, recovered the equipment used in the hacking and received a confession from the suspect.

The government, however, has dismissed Coupang's findings as a ""unilateral claim,"" noting that a joint public-private investigation into the incident has yet to release any conclusions. On November 29, Coupang confirmed that the personal information of 33. 7 million customer accounts had been exposed, far exceeding the 4, 500 accounts initially reported to authorities on Nov. 20. Given that active users of Coupang's product commerce division, including its delivery service, reached 24. 7 million in the third quarter, the scale of the breach suggests that nearly the entire user base may have been affected.

Coinbase arrested a former Indian employee linked to a major data breach affecting customer information. Hackers bribed overseas staff for data and demanded a $20M ransom. The investigation is international, with cooperation from law enforcement. Coinbase has confirmed the arrest of a former customer service employee in India in connection with a major data breach at the company earlier this year.

He stated that the company has zero tolerance for misconduct and will continue working with authorities worldwide to hold those involved accountable. According to Armstrong, the arrested individual is a former Coinbase support agent, and more arrests are expected as investigations continue.

Key Points: Kuaishou faced a cyberattack on its livestreaming platform. Service quickly restored with no broader impact. Shares dropped 3-6% during the incident. On December 22, 2025, Kuaishou’s live streaming platform faced cyberattacks, disrupting services. Kuaishou, listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, quickly enacted a contingency plan. The attack highlights vulnerabilities in tech infrastructure and raises concerns on cybersecurity, yet Kuaishou’s swift response minimized damage, with no reported impact on other app functionalities. Livestreaming Cyberattack Costs Kuaishou HK$16 Billion in Value Kuaishou (01024.HK) experienced a cyberattack on December 22, 2025, targeting its livestreaming service. The attack was identified at approximately 22:00 Beijing time and involved the flooding of the platform with explicit content. Kuaishou immediately activated its contingency plan to manage the situation. The livestreaming function resumed normal operations following prompt efforts to repair the system, minimizing broader impacts. No other services were affected. As Wang Liejun, Chief Expert at QAX, noted, “The cybercriminal industry has entered an era of ‘automated attacks’, while many platforms still rely heavily on manual moderation.” The event underscored vulnerabilities in content moderation systems, as cybercriminals exploited these weaknesses. Market reactions saw Kuaishou’s shares drop 3-6% amid investor concerns, translating to an estimated loss of HK$16 billion in market value. Despite limited public statements, the company reported its actions to relevant authorities for further investigation. Cybersecurity Threats: Lessons from Repeated Attacks Did you know?

How did the breach occur? Shortly after Thanksgiving, we detected that a person within the NPMS organization (identity redacted for anonymity) clicked on a link entitled, “Winner!!! Claim FREE 6XL Red Coat With Fur Trim Now!” Regrettably, this turned out to be a phishing scheme that exploited a vulnerability in our system. We now understand that the innocent enchantment of believing hearts is not a reliable form of cybersecurity. While we have yet to pinpoint the attacker’s identity, we have narrowed the suspects down to three previous perpetrators of crimes against the season: E. Scrooge, Mr. Grinch, and Big City Lady-Lawyer With Christmas Eve Deadline. What information was involved? When you opted in to NPMS (by requesting an item from St. Nick or his mall representative), you granted us express permission to access your biodata in order to make a list, check it twice, and upload it to a third-party cloud service. This information includes, but is not limited to, your: Favorite sports team Mom’s cookie-baking prowess Percentage of nightly REM resulting in sugar plum visions Ability to hear ethereal ring of a magic sleighbell Home blueprints with detailed notes on how to bypass the security system to both enter and leave undetected by all humans and pets in the vicinity What you can do Please take precautions to monitor your Naughty Indicator of Coal Offering (NICO) Score, the number used to predict your likelihood of receiving coal for bad behavior. Your NICO Score appears in your annual Naughty or Nice Report, which you can request for free from SantasBigBookOfKids@me. com. You should review all indiscretions for accuracy and let us know immediately if you see a tantrum you didn’t throw or a pigtail you didn’t yank. All legitimate disputes will be brought to binding arbitration before a retired Elf on the Shelf. Additionally, take stock of your and your peers’ presents for signs of fraudulent activity. For instance, did it seem suspicious that your “big gift” was a set of sight word flashcards despite you being very cool about never telling anyone that Lucas M. peed his pants on the field trip to the arboretum? Or maybe your three-year-old cousin received a limited edition Labubu even though last month she bit your arm so hard it left teeth marks through your corduroy jacket. Report all these and similar incongruous giftings to NPMS. We can’t issue adjustments now that the big guy has flown, but we can utilize our cross-departmental collaboration with the Tooth Fairy to advocate for suitable molar remuneration. What you shouldn’t do To maintain your confidence in NPMS, please don’t discuss the contents of this letter with any kind of mean older siblings. Note that showing up to a police department will result only in hair tousling and lighthearted chuckles. There is also no need to share these materials with the Goldstein twins next door; we can assure you their data was not affected. What we are doing We sincerely regret any inconvenience caused by this incident, and in acknowledgement of our missteps, are offering compensation in the form of you getting the top ask on your wish list next year, with the following caveats: Must be suitably in line with your household income Tangible items only (i. e., not the gift of your divorced parents getting back together-we cannot make that happen. They seem much happier now, anyway) It will arrive in wrapping paper you’ve definitely seen in the garage before. And if you’re wondering if Santa is now being mandated to add two-factor authentication to his iPad-yes, Virginia, he is.

The Genians Security Center (GSC), a South Korean cybersecurity institute, said in a report that it detected the operation believed to have been carried out by APT37, a Pyongyang-backed cyber hacking group, reports Yonhap news agency. According to the report, the threat actors embedded malicious object linking and embedding (OLE) code inside Hangul Word Processor (HWP) documents. An attack chain is triggered when a user allows the opening of the document's content and clicks a hyperlink in the file. HWP is a document file format widely used as a standard in South Korea. The findings follow an October report by 38 North, a U. S.-based website monitoring North Korea, which said North Korean cyber operators have repeatedly exploited the HWP format to infiltrate government, military and key industrial networks in South Korea.""This attack demonstrates APT37's ongoing pattern of highly developed reconnaissance and infiltration activities,"" the GSC report said. ""It also indicates that the group continues to refine its capabilities by leveraging advanced technical methods.""In November, a North Korea-linked hacking group launched a new form of cyberattack that remotely controls Android smartphones and personal computers (PCs) to delete key data, including photos, documents and contact information. They remotely reset the smartphones after using Google's location-based tracking system to confirm the victims were outside their homes or offices. The remote reset halted normal device operation, blocking notification and message alerts from messenger apps and effectively cutting off the account owner's awareness channel, thereby delaying detection and response, the report explained. Through this process, key data stored on the infected devices, including photos, documents and contacts, were completely deleted.",2025-12-22T09:03:08,False,False,False,False,True,True

A Ukrainian national has pleaded guilty to multiple crimes due to his involvement in a string of ransomware attacks targeting firms in the United States and Europe. Artem Aleksandrovych Stryzhak, a 35-year-old Ukrainian national, was accused of targeting these organizations from 2018 to late 2021. According to reports, the Ukrainian could face up to 10 years in prison for conspiracy to commit fraud, including extortion. The Ukrainian was arrested in Spain in June 2024 and was subsequently extradited to the United States in April. Authorities are still on the lookout for his co-conspirator, Volodymyr Tymoshchuk, who now has a bounty of $11 million for any information leading to his arrest. Ukrainian pleads guilty over ransomware crimes Joseph Nocella, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement that the defendant used Nefilim ransomware to target high-revenue companies in the United States. He would often steal data and encrypt it, only agreeing to release the data after his demands, which are often financial, have been met. “We remain determined to capture Stryzhak’s codefendant and partner in crime, Volodymyr Tymoshchuk, and bring him to justice in a U. S. courtroom,” Nocella added. The Ukrainian is now being accused of acting as the administrator of the Nefilim ransomware group and is described as a serial cybercriminal associated with multiple ransomware organizations. Officials claimed that attacks carried out by Nefilim ransomware have led to the loss of millions of damages through extortion payments and damage to victim networks. Styzhak and his co-conspirators allegedly customized ransomware files for each victim, creating unique decryption keys and ransom notes. The ransomware group primarily targeted companies located in the United States, Australia, and Canada, netting more than $100 million in annual revenue.

Government systems in the United Kingdom have been breached in a cyber attack linked to China, with suspicions pointing to a group called Storm 1849, according to a report from the BBC. The incident involved sensitive data handled by the Foreign Office on behalf of the Home Office, and though officials say the risk to individuals remains low, the breach has triggered a full-blown investigation across multiple agencies. Trade Minister Chris Bryant confirmed on Friday that the breach was real and being investigated.“We think that it is a fairly low-risk that individuals will have been compromised or affected,” Chris said. He also made it clear that the security loophole had been “closed pretty quickly.” Still, when asked by Times Radio about whether the attack was linked directly to the Chinese state, he replied, “I’m not able to say whether it is directly related to Chinese operatives, or indeed the Chinese state.” Officials confirm breach involved government-run visa data systems The October cyber incident may have targeted visa-related data, putting thousands of sensitive records at risk. The Foreign Office detected the activity, and the case has now been referred to the Information Commissioner’s Office. The UK government has not publicly named the perpetrators, but Chris said agencies were “working to investigate” what happened. The suspected involvement of a China-affiliated group brings even more attention to recent alerts from UK intelligence services. Agencies including GCHQ have repeatedly warned that China’s espionage operations are becoming more aggressive, especially when it comes to stealing political and commercial information. GCHQ stated last year that more resources were being thrown at dealing with China than any other country. When asked about the UK’s digital readiness, Jamie MacColl, a Senior Research Fellow in Cyber and Tech at the Royal United Services Institute, said part of the problem is.",2025-12-19T12:29:42,False,False,True,False,True,True

In brief U. S. prosecutors have indicted Mykhalio Petrovich Chudnovets, a Russian national accused of running E-Note. Authorities seized E-Note’s servers and websites, alleging the service laundered over $70 million in illicit crypto. The action highlights an intensifying crackdown on crypto laundering tied to ransomware and cybercrime. Federal prosecutors in Michigan, working with international partners, have disrupted an online cryptocurrency laundering service known as E-Note and unsealed an indictment against its alleged operator, a Russian national accused of helping cybercriminals move illicit funds across borders. The U. S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan said Wednesday that the FBI, Michigan State Police, and foreign law enforcement agencies seized E-Note’s online infrastructure as part of a coordinated operation targeting a network allegedly used by transnational cybercriminal organizations, including groups that attacked U. S. healthcare systems and critical infrastructure. Prosecutors also announced charges against Mykhalio Petrovich Chudnovets, 39, who is accused of running the service and conspiring to launder criminal proceeds. Chudnovets is charged with one count of conspiracy to launder monetary instruments, an offense that carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. The indictment, originally filed in September, was unsealed Wednesday. “Chudnovets worked with financially motivated cybercriminals to transfer criminal proceeds across international borders and to convert criminal proceeds from cryptocurrency into fiat currencies,” read the indictment. “Originally Chudnovets offered what appeared to be a personally provided service using individual ‘money mules’,” it went on. “Since approximately 2017, he has offered his services through an online business called e-note.” Since 2017, the FBI has identified more than $70 million in illicit proceeds from ransomware attacks, account takeovers, and other cyber-enabled crimes that were transferred through the E-Note payment service and its associated money mule network. ﻿ According to court documents, Chudnovets started offering money laundering services to cybercriminals as early.",2025-12-18T23:01:26,True,False,False,False,False,True

AT&T notified millions of customers that information ranging from Social Security numbers to call records were compromised in these breaches last year. It sparked a wave of lawsuits, which were later consolidated, that accused AT&T of not protecting consumers’ data. While AT&T has continued to deny wrongdoing, it opted to settle earlier this year.

In the first incident, which occurred on March 30, 2024, AT&T said some customers’ data including addresses, social security numbers, birthdates, passcodes, billing numbers and phone numbers were released on the dark web, the Kroll Settlement Administration said. The other breach involved call and text records of nearly all AT&T customers from May through October of 2022, as well as a small subset from Jan. 2, 2023. AT&T said it learned that data was “illegally downloaded from our workspace on a third-party cloud platform” in April of last year and began notifying customers in July 2024, after launching an investigation. While AT&T has continued to deny wrongdoing, it opted to settle earlier this year. “We have agreed to this settlement to avoid the expense and uncertainty of protracted litigation,” AT&T said in a statement, adding that the company remains “committed to protecting our customers’ data and ensuring their continued trust in us.” Who is eligible for the AT&T settlement?

This reflects a deeper architectural flaw in digital identity systems where data oversharing is an unavoidable outcome of how identity verification is designed, said Javed Khattak, co-founder and chief financial officer of cheqd, a payment infrastructure firm. “We don’t know the exact dataset involved, but in e-commerce it’s common to store sensitive information like full birth dates when all the company needs is an age check,” he said in an interview with The Korea Times. The pattern exists across industries. Sometimes it’s driven by regulation, but far more often it’s driven by marketing, profiling and recommendation engines, in his view. “The underlying issue is that most companies treat personal data as fuel for their business, resulting in an aim to collect as much as possible rather than to minimize. The cheapest option is simply to store everything indefinitely, even when it.",2025-12-18T06:17:02,False,False,True,False,False,False

Crypto Projects Analyst says SOL is in a wait-and-see posture amid recent Solana price predictions, as a DDoS attack targets the network and DeepSnitch AI approaches the reward program deadline. Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana, disclosed an industrial-scale distributed denial-of-service attack targeting the network this week. Although the attack-induced traffic peaked at approximately six terabits per second (Tbps), it had minimal impact on the network. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking on the DeepSnitch AI bonus program, which rewards participants in its ongoing presale with tokens worth up to 100% of their invested capital. Set to end on New Year’s Eve, the initiative highlights DeepSnitch AI’s effort to encourage early-stage participation. Trading at $0. 02846, this period presents an opportunity to accumulate the presale token, particularly as recent Solana price predictions place SOL in an indecisive position. To date, more than $821,000 has been invested in DeepSnitch AI, reflecting growing interest. For more information about the DeepSnitch AI bonus program and Solana price prediction, read on. Solana co-founder frames DDoS attack on network as bullish Yakovenko wrote about the attack in an X post on December 9, noting that it had surged to 6 Tbps at the time. Other accounts associated with Solana also spotlighted the incident. In particular, Raj Gokal, president and co-founder of Solana Labs, noted that the attack is still ongoing. Also remarking on the attack was David Rhodus, CEO of Solana-based DePIN project Pipe Network, who described the scale of the attack as industrial-level. Despite the DDoS attack, the network’s performance has not been affected to date. Yakovenko calls it a bullish outcome because someone is spending the same amount the network makes in revenue to initiate this attack, and it is futile.

Solana withstood a 6 Tbps DDoS attack for over a week, maintaining full operational stability with no downtime or delays. Solana’s blockchain recently faced a major Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack, yet it remained fully operational. The attack lasted for over a week, peaking at 6 terabits per second (Tbps). Despite the high volume of malicious traffic, the network did not experience any downtime or disruptions. This resilience highlights the strength of Solana’s infrastructure in handling extreme security threats. Solana Maintains Smooth Operation During DDoS Attack Throughout the duration of the attack, Solana’s network continued to perform without any issues. The blockchain successfully processed transactions without delays, confirming them in around 450 milliseconds on average. Even at peak traffic, the network kept generating blocks and ensuring that transactions were finalized in near real-time. This smooth operation proves the blockchain’s ability to manage high-pressure situations. The attack lasted for over a week, but Solana’s system remained unaffected. Validators were able to produce blocks without encountering delays or failures. The blockchain’s infrastructure held strong, despite the immense stress placed on the system. As a result, Solana’s network continued to operate at full capacity with no interruptions. This level of stability is particularly significant given the scale of the attack. With traffic reaching 6 Tbps, it ranked as one of the largest DDoS assaults recorded. 🧬 while everyone was watching btc dump to $86k 𝐒𝐎𝐋𝐀𝐍𝐀 𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐞𝐭𝐥𝐲 𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝟒𝐭𝐡 𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐃𝐃𝐨𝐒 𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐢𝐧 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐞𝐝 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐭 𝐡𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲 6 terabits per secondbillions of packetssustained for days zero downtimezero. pic. twitter. com/zjZYZYOEfS 0xSatosha (❖,❖) ✨★ (@infoCryptoWeb3) December 16, 2025 Yet, Solana’s blockchain was able to absorb this volume of malicious requests without any impact on performance.

Solana has endured a massive 6 Tbps DDoS attack with minimal disruption, showcasing enhanced network resilience. Co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko described it as “bullish,” noting attackers are spending heavily without causing significant downtime. This industrial-scale assault highlights Solana’s improved defenses against cyber threats. Solana’s 6 Tbps DDoS attack peaked at billions of packets per second, yet the network maintained operations without visible latency or failures. The assault, ongoing as of December 2025, underscores Solana’s evolution from past vulnerabilities to robust infrastructure.

Solana DDoS attack: Network withstands 6 Tbps assault with no downtime. Learn how resilience has improved and what it means for blockchain security. Stay informed on crypto threats. What is the Solana DDoS attack and its impact? Solana DDoS attack refers to a powerful distributed denial-of-service campaign targeting the Solana blockchain, peaking at six terabits per second in December 2025. This event demonstrates Solana’s strengthened architecture, allowing seamless transaction processing under extreme pressure. How has Solana’s network stability evolved amid DDoS threats? Solana’s history with network disruptions has been marked by several incidents, but recent upgrades have bolstered its defenses. In 2020, a block propagation issue caused a halt, while 2021 saw a 17-hour downtime from a token launch overload resembling a DDoS. Experts from Solana Labs note that post-2022 improvements, including better consensus mechanisms, reduced vulnerabilities. For instance, 2023’s single 19-hour outage stemmed from deduplication logic faults, and 2024 experienced just a five-hour downtime due to a recompile loop bug.

The Solana blockchain faced one of its toughest real-world tests after sustaining sustained distributed denial-of-service pressure for more than a week. Despite the scale of the attack, the network continued processing transactions and producing blocks without downtime. Network Performance Holds Under Extreme Load Reports indicated the attack peaked near six terabits per second, a level comparable to major incidents previously observed on cloud providers like Google Cloud and AWS. However, Solana’s monitoring data showed stable performance throughout the period. Blocks continued to finalize on schedule, and transaction confirmations remained consistent. Data cited by Pipe Network showed average confirmation times around 450 milliseconds, while even the slowest transactions stayed below 700 milliseconds. Slot production also remained steady, with minimal missed slots. Hence, validators continued operating normally despite the sustained traffic surge, contradicting expectations of congestion or network delays. Significantly, experts had anticipated slower confirmations and reduced throughput under such pressure. Instead, the network demonstrated improved traffic handling compared with earlier years. Additionally, comparisons emerged with a recent DDoS incident affecting the Sui network, where block production slowed and performance suffered. That contrast highlighted differing resilience outcomes across blockchain architectures. Context From Past Incidents and Market Response Solana’s ability to withstand the attack drew attention partly because of its history. In 2022, similar stress exposed weaknesses that led to instability and outages. However, ongoing upgrades appear to have strengthened the network’s capacity to manage extreme demand. Moreover, other blockchains have also faced attempted DDoS activity, including Cardano, which detected attack patterns without direct mainnet disruption. Market participants reacted cautiously but positively. Solana’s token price edged higher during the period, signaling confidence in the network’s stability.

The gap has intensified calls to amend the Personal Information Protection Act and raise the required coverage level. Coupang is insured under Meritz Fire & Marine Insurance’s data breach liability policy, but the coverage limit is only 1 billion won ($680,000). In effect, even if the company is ordered to compensate victims, the insurance would pay out no more than 1 billion won, an amount far too small given the magnitude of the breach. The U. S.-listed e-commerce giant revealed late last month that around 33. 7 million customer accounts were deliberately leaked by an internal employee, exposing the personal information of nearly three out of every four adults in Korea. If a court holds the company liable, its compensation burden could reach at least 3. 37 trillion won, based on precedents awarding about 100, 000 won per.",2025-12-08T06:32:02,False,False,True,False,True,False

Key Points: South Korea considers no-fault liability for virtual asset exchanges. Legislation aims to enhance operator accountability in cyber attacks. Pending fines could reach 3% of sales for hacking cases. South Korea’s Financial Services Commission is contemplating imposing no-fault liability on virtual asset operators for hacking-related damages, according to a Yonhap News Agency report on December 7. This potential legislation aligns virtual asset operators with financial institutions, impacting regulatory dynamics and market stability in South Korea’s evolving crypto sector. South Korea Targets Crypto Exchanges with 3% Sales Fines The Financial Services Commission (FSC) of South Korea is considering adding a clause to its draft legislation, imposing no-fault liability on virtual asset operators. This move follows a series of 20 computer incidents on top Korean won exchanges, emphasizing the need for enhanced security measures. The FSC aims to align virtual asset exchange liabilities with those of financial companies. South Korean lawmakers are debating stricter penalties, with proposed fines reaching 3% of sales revenue, paralleling measures in the Electronic Financial Transactions Act. Current maximum fines are capped at 5 billion won. This legislative shift reflects the government’s commitment to improving user protection and response strategies in the crypto sector. Industry reactions have been mixed. While there has been no official statement from major exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb, stakeholders are closely monitoring developments. Discussions on cryptocurrency forums and social media emphasize the potential impact on exchange compliance efforts and security enhancements. No-Fault Liability: Potential Game-Changer for Crypto Compliance Did you know? The concept of no-fault liability is already applied to South Korean banks for voice phishing cases, setting a precedent for proposed crypto exchange regulations. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin (BTC), as of 06: 31 UTC on December 7, 2025, has a market cap of $1. 79 trillion.

The move is a shift to treat major crypto exchanges as rigorously as traditional financial platforms, applying similar scrutiny to compliance, consumer protection standards and the overall regulatory guidelines for Korea’s fast-growing crypto market. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) is reviewing provisions that would require virtual asset service providers, or crypto exchanges, to compensate users for losses caused by hacking or system failures regardless of whether the exchange is at fault. This no-fault standard is currently applied only to financial institutions and electronic payment firms under the law governing electronic financial transactions. Propelling the move is a Nov. 27 Upbit incident that saw more than 104 billion Solana-based coins totaling about 44. 5 billion won ($30. 1 million).",2025-12-07T06:02:03,False,False,True,False,True,False

The Donjon research team at cryptocurrency security firm Ledger has discovered a critical vulnerability in a smartphone processor widely used in the Android ecosystem. The vulnerability puts users, particularly those using software-based Web3 wallets, at risk of having their digital assets compromised if their devices are physically compromised. Ledger researchers, conducting research on the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 chip manufactured by TSMC, have demonstrated that the processor’s secure boot process can be bypassed using electromagnetic fault injection (EMFI). The vulnerability allows attackers to gain full control over the processor by disabling the earliest security checks in the device’s boot ROM. Using open-source tools, the team fired electromagnetic pulses at the precise moment to access the boot ROM’s operating system. The chip’s write command filtering mechanism was then bypassed, altering the return address in the ROM stack. This method allowed arbitrary code execution at EL3, the processor’s highest privilege level. According to Ledger, the attack can be replicated within minutes. The company emphasized that this finding doesn’t affect Ledger hardware wallets, arguing that “even the most advanced smartphone chips are vulnerable to physical attacks.” Ledger stated that smartphones used as hot wallets are not suitable for storing private keys, and that true security can be achieved with hardware wallets that include secure elements. *This is not investment advice. account now for exclusive news, analytics and on-chain data!

According to the web infrastructure and security company, the activity originated from a DDoS botnet-for-hire known as AISURU.

A former employee, A Chinese national who quit in December 2024, is suspected of being behind the breach. Appearing at a parliamentary session on Tuesday, Coupang CEO Park Dae-jun said the suspect had worked as a developer on the company’s authentication and system access management team. The attacker is believed to have extracted customer information after leaving the company, by exploiting authentication tokens and a signing key. An authentication token acts like a temporary access pass issued after a user logs in, and a signing key is used to create and verify those tokens. Coupang failed to revoke or rotate the signing key even after the employee’s departure, exposing a serious gap in the company’s cybersecurity controls. “The suspect could be an individual or multiple people.",2025-12-03T07:02:03,False,False,True,False,False,True

The multi-million-dollar Solana hot wallet breach on crypto exchange Upbit on Thursday was the work of North Korean hackers, South Korean authorities now suspect. How Lazarus Group Robbed Upbit Again, Six Years Later The huge theft of 44. 5 billion Korean won (approximately $30. 4 million) from a Upbit hot wallet, which forced the exchange to suspend deposits and withdrawals, was linked to a group known as Lazarus, according to a Yonhap report. The development follows Upbit’s announcement on Thursday that it had noted irregular withdrawals on the Solana network, prompting it to move remaining funds offline and commit to fully compensating affected customers. The hack marked the platform’s second major hot wallet breach in six years. South Korean authorities believe the latest security breach involved the hijacking or impersonation of administrator credentials to authorize the transfers, an attack vector similar to the one used by the infamous Lazarus Group in the 2019 $50 million hack. The Lazarus Group is a North Korean state-sponsored hacking outfit long associated with high-profile crypto thefts. The group has been tied to major exploits targeting exchanges, decentralized finance protocols, and infrastructure providers. Advertisement On-chain sleuthing conducted by Arkham Intelligence early this year linked the $1. 5 billion hack of crypto exchange Bybit to North Korea’s Lazarus Group, which is one of the largest crypto hacks recorded. Meanwhile, a wallet seemingly tied to the 2025 Upbit hacker has swapped the ill-gotten Solana tokens for USDC and is bridging funds to Ethereum, on-chain data tracked by Dethective shows. As ZyCrypto previously reported, the Thursday hack coincided with a major corporate merger announcement involving Upbit’s parent company, Dunamu, and Korean internet giant Naver. Naver Financial announced Wednesday that it will integrate Dunamu as its wholly-owned subsidiary as part of a $10. 3 billion all-stock deal.",2025-11-28T14:26:11,False,False,True,False,True,True

South Korea’s financial sector was hit by a coordinated Russia-North Korea supply chain attack using Qilin ransomware, with 2 TB of sensitive banking data stolen. Summary Bitdefender’s October Threat Debrief details how threat actors breached a third‑party vendor to infiltrate multiple South Korean financial institutions. Attackers deployed Qilin ransomware across compromised networks after initial access, exfiltrating roughly 2 terabytes of data from targeted banks. The joint involvement of Russian and North Korean state‑linked actors marks an escalation in supply chain tactics against critical financial infrastructure. South Korea’s financial sector suffered a coordinated supply chain attack attributed to Russian and North Korean threat actors, resulting in the deployment of Qilin ransomware and the theft of sensitive data, according to cybersecurity firm Bitdefender. The attack, detailed in Bitdefender’s Threat Debrief October report, led to the compromise of multiple South Korean banking institutions. The firm stated it began investigating the campaign after identifying suspicious activity linked to the threat actors. Analysts warn of more coordinated ransomware attacks by Russian and North Korean hackers The coordinated operation involved threat actors from both Russia and North Korea working in tandem to breach the financial institutions’ systems, Bitdefender reported. The attackers successfully exfiltrated approximately 2 terabytes of data from the targeted banks. The supply chain attack method allowed the threat actors to gain access to multiple organizations through a compromised third-party vendor or service provider, according to the report. Following initial access, the attackers deployed Qilin ransomware across the compromised networks. Bitdefender confirmed the findings in its monthly threat intelligence report covering October activity. The cybersecurity firm did not immediately disclose the specific identities of the affected South Korean financial institutions or the timeline of the breach.

Did you know that North Korea ranks as the world’s third-largest Bitcoin holder? This shocking revelation comes as Binance, the global cryptocurrency giant, intensifies its surveillance of North Korean crypto hacking operations that threaten the entire digital asset ecosystem. Why Is North Korean Crypto Hacking So Dangerous? North Korea’s sophisticated cyber operations have evolved into a major threat to cryptocurrency security. According to Kim Min-jae, Binance’s specialist investigator, these illicit activities involve complex hacking schemes that steal virtual assets through various criminal methods. The stolen funds then spread across multiple exchanges, creating a web of illegal transactions that challenges global security protocols. During the recent “Binance Blockchain Study” event in Seoul, investigators revealed the alarming scale of these operations. The North Korean crypto hacking network operates with military precision, targeting digital assets to bypass international sanctions and fund prohibited activities. How Does Binance Combat This Threat? Binance employs advanced monitoring systems to track suspicious activities linked to North Korean crypto hacking. The exchange’s security team focuses on several key areas: Real-time transaction monitoring across the blockchain network Pattern recognition algorithms that detect unusual fund movements International collaboration with law enforcement agencies Multi-exchange coordination to track fund dispersal The exchange’s proactive approach to monitoring North Korean crypto hacking demonstrates its commitment to maintaining market integrity. By identifying and reporting suspicious transactions, Binance helps prevent the laundering of illegally obtained digital assets. What Makes This Monitoring So Crucial? The persistence of North Korean crypto hacking poses significant risks to the entire cryptocurrency industry. These operations not only steal valuable assets but also undermine trust in digital currencies. When hackers successfully move stolen funds through multiple exchanges, they create challenges for regulatory compliance and investor protection. Moreover, the sophistication of North Korean crypto hacking techniques continues to evolve. Investigators note that these groups.",2025-11-24T07:13:11,False,False,False,False,True,False

In his blog post that breaks down what happened, however, Matthew Prince explained that after realizing their mistake, his team was able to fix the issue. “The issue was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a cyber attack or malicious activity of any kind,” he wrote. It was instead caused by a change to its database systems’ permissions, which led to an issue with a file used by its Bot Management system. The company’s Bot Management system uses a machine learning model to score bots for every request they make when they crawl Cloudflare’s network. Its clients rely on those bot scores to decide whether to allow or to block specific bots from accessing their websites. One the uses of having bot scores is being able to block AI companies’ bots so they can’t use a website’s content to train their LLMs. In July, Cloudflare launched an experiment called “pay per crawl,” which allows website owners to let an AI bot crawl their pages if they get paid for access. Prince said the model relies on a “feature” configuration file to make a prediction on whether a bot request was automated or not. The feature file is refreshed every few minutes, and a change in the underlying mechanism generating that file caused a change in its size that triggered the error. “As a result, HTTP 5xx error codes were returned by the core proxy system that handles traffic processing for our customers, for any traffic that depended on the bots module,” Prince wrote. This recent event has been Cloudflare’s worst outage in years. The company said it hasn’t had an outage that has “caused the majority of core traffic to stop flowing through [its] network” since 2019. Prince apologized for the issue on behalf of his team. On November 18 Cloudflare experienced a service outage, triggered by an issue with a Bot Management feature, impacting multiple Cloudflare services. Here's a detailed breakdown of what happened.

Government agencies, just like corporations and individuals, are potential targets for cybercriminals seeking to exploit vulnerabilities. A recent report by Politico highlights a persistent cybersecurity threat at the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), underscoring the ever-present risk facing government agencies. Understanding the Role of the Congressional Budget Office The Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, plays a critical role in the U. S. government. It provides nonpartisan analyses for economic and budgetary decisions crucial to the legislative process. As such, the security and integrity of its data and communication systems are of paramount importance. Any breach could potentially have significant implications for national policy and economic strategy. Why Cybersecurity Matters for the CBO Data Integrity: Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of financial data is crucial. Network Security: Protection of sensitive data from unauthorized access is essential. Reputation: As a source of nonpartisan information, maintaining trust in the CBO's reports is vital. Cybersecurity Threat Landscape According to the Politico report, the CBO is facing the ongoing challenge of protecting its systems against a variety of cyber threats. In today’s interconnected world, cyber risks are particularly salient and can manifest in various forms, such as: Phishing Attacks: These are deceptive attempts to obtain sensitive information through fraudulent communication. Ransomware: Malicious software that encrypts data, demanding a ransom for access restoration. Malware: Any software intentionally designed to cause disruption or damage to a computer, server, or network. The proliferation of these threats necessitates robust cybersecurity strategies specifically tailored to counteract such risks. Politico's Report: Key Highlights Politico’s report delves into the persistent cybersecurity challenges faced by the CBO, bringing to light several key insights: Increased Cybersecurity Funding and Measures To combat growing threats, the CBO has been granted increased funding dedicated specifically to cybersecurity enhancements. Investments are being made in advanced defense mechanisms, such as next-gen firewalls and enhanced encryption techniques. Efforts are underway to improve staff training and awareness to better defend against social engineering attacks. Challenges and Potential Vulnerabilities Legacy Systems: Older systems may lack the modern security features necessary to protect against sophisticated attacks. Resource Constraints: Balancing budgetary and resource allocation can limit the scope and efficacy of security measures. Staff Awareness: Ensuring all employees are adequately trained and vigilant against potential threats is an ongoing process. This comprehensive focus highlights the significance of preparedness and responsive measures in safeguarding sensitive government information. Enhancing Cybersecurity at the CBO There are several strategic steps the CBO can take to better safeguard its systems against cyber threats. Here are some recommended approaches: Adopting a Proactive Security Strategy Regular Security Audits: Conducting frequent audits to identify and rectify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Incident Response Planning: Developing a robust incident response strategy to quickly and efficiently counteract cyber events. Advanced Threat Detection: Employing artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect and respond to anomalies in real-time. Fostering a Culture of Cyber Awareness Continuous Training: Deploying regular training sessions to keep employees informed about the latest cyber threats. Security Drills: Implementing scenarios and drills to test and improve response times and procedures. Encouraging Reporting: Promoting a culture where employees feel comfortable reporting potential security incidents without trepidation. Conclusion The cybersecurity threat landscape remains a critical concern for the Congressional Budget Office. As cyber threats grow in sophistication and frequency, it becomes more imperative for government agencies like the CBO to reinforce their cybersecurity measures. By adopting a holistic security strategy, remaining vigilant, and fostering a proactive culture around cybersecurity, the CBO can better protect its vital resources. The lessons learned and strategies developed in safeguarding the CBO could serve as a valuable benchmark for other government bodies facing similar challenges. Ultimately, the report by Politico underscores a crucial reality: protecting the integrity and safety of digital systems is a continuous journey that demands constant attention and adaptation.

00bf047d-126d-4284-9c11-dfb4854b422a,RondoDox Explodes: Unpatched XWiki Servers Are Fueling a Massive 2025 Cyber Attack Wave,PCQuest,https://www.pcquest.com/security-products/rondodox-explodes-unpatched-xwiki-servers-are-fueling-a-massive-2025-cyber-attack-wave-10782430,"A major vulnerability in XWiki has created a serious opportunity for attackers. The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-24893, permits even guest users to execute remote code on a server through the /bin/get/Main/SolrSearch endpoint. With the vulnerability, anyone that finds the weakness will be able to execute commands on the system as if they were a member of the system. The XWiki team triaged and fixed the bug in February 2025 with updates to versions 15. 10. 11, 16. 4. 1, and 16. 5. 0RC1. However, many users were never updated, which would leave their servers vulnerable long after the bug was fixed. Early signs of trouble In March, attackers began attempting to exploit the bug in a quiet manner. These early attempts were small and easy to overlook. The real trouble began in late October when VulnCheck revealed coordinated activity exploiting the bug. Attackers began to utilize the bug to load cryptocurrency miners. A miner utilizes the victim's CPU for profit for the attacker while slowing down the server's performance. The issue escalated quickly and prompted CISA to add the bug to its list of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities and mandate federal agencies to patch the bug before November 20. RondoDox Enters the Scene How the Botnet Gets Going While some miners were cashing in on the vulnerability, another group swooped in-a more aggressive bunch. They're the ones behind RondoDox, a botnet that lures in vulnerable devices and uses them to launch distributed denial of service attacks. These attacks just swamp a target with loads of traffic across all the usual protocols like HTTP, UDP & TCP. When they spotted unpatched XWiki servers going live, RondoDox pounced. A Big Jump in Attacks The first RondoDox exploit attempt linked to that vulnerability showed up on November 3, 2025. Within days VulnCheck saw a major spike in activity. Attempt after attempt just poured in with a peak on November 7, then a second surge on November 11. These attacks weren't coming from one source; they were happening all over the place. Multiple actors were all scrambling to find that one weakness & take control of as many systems as they could. Some folks were trying to build these botnets, others were deploying mining rigs, and there were even some going for reverse shells to get in long-term. With automated scanning tools like Nuclei templates, even the not-so-skilled can just jump in with minimal fuss once a template is out there. This Affects Small Teams & Young Pros Too The Risk You Might Be Overlooking Young developers, students, small startups, and anyone using open-source tools like XWiki for projects, clubs, or side gigs are often running on cloud servers that they forget about once they're up & running. Attackers don't care who owns the machine; they just want to know if it responds. An unpatched service is all they need to take control. What Happens After the Breach Once the bad guys get in, the server can become a botnet node, a mining rig, or a backdoor for a deeper intrusion. Even more, it can be used to stash some nasty files or be a launchpad for other attacks. Often the owner doesn't even notice anything's wrong till the server starts slowing down or a cloud provider starts poking around. Staying safe in a fast-moving threat environment The message from XWiki is simple. When a vulnerability is made publicly known, the internet moves at high speed. An attacker finds an opportunity. Other attackers replicate the same tactic. Soon enough, thousands of systems will face the same threat. The only way to defend against this is to patch quickly and configure appropriately. Users should patch XWiki to a version that contains the patches, examine logs to see if there has been unauthorized access, disable guest accounts that are not needed, and avoid exposing administrative interfaces to the internet. If users regularly maintained the systems and patched quickly, compromising XWiki would not have made a difference, as botnets such as RondoDox could have been avoided. Furthermore, the XWiki incident is simply another reminder of how a day or two delay in patching can lead to larger problems that could have been avoided. Such a simple patch could have determined the difference between compromising a user's system and having a secure system that was not being used as a host for an attacker evading detection.

Phishing Schemes: Fraudsters impersonate official entities to steal sensitive information through deceptive emails and websites. Data Breaches: Unauthorized access can lead to mass leaks of confidential information, with long-lasting repercussions. Response Efforts by The Manassas City School District Safeguarding students and staff in the wake of such an incident requires a robust and coordinated response from the district. Superintendent Dr. Evan Green outlined a multi-step approach to address the breach: Investigation: Collaboration with cybersecurity experts to identify the breach source and its extent. Containment: Immediate steps to contain the breach and prevent further unauthorized access. Communication: Regular updates to stakeholders with clear instructions and truthful information. Restoration: Efforts to restore systems and resumes usual school operations as swiftly as possible. Future Safeguards and Strategic Improvements The incident has acted as a catalyst for the district to reassess its cybersecurity posture. Potential future actions include: Investment in Security Infrastructure: Exploring improved technology and systems to better protect against threats. Staff Training: Enhancing awareness and training to reduce human error as a vulnerability point. Regular Security Audits: Establishing consistent, thorough evaluations of internal security measures. The Role of Parents and the Community While schools bear the brunt of cybersecurity responsibilities, parents and the wider community play vital roles in safeguarding schools digitally. Community efforts can significantly bolster cybersecurity defenses: Communication: Staying informed about school security policies and changes to ensure transparency and accountability. Home Security: Ensuring personal devices connected to school networks are secure. Vigilance: Reporting suspicious activity related to school operations promptly. Conclusion The recent closure of Manassas City Schools serves as a crucial learning point for educational institutions across the globe. It highlights the necessity of robust cybersecurity measures and proactive community engagement to defend against growing digital threats. As schools continue to embrace technology, prioritizing cybersecurity is not just beneficial it’s essential.

And impacted consumers have a little over a month left to file a claim for their chunk of the money. Several lawsuits emerged across the U. S. and were later consolidated after AT&T notified millions of customers that information ranging from Social Security numbers to call records were compromised in these breaches last year. Plaintiffs alleged that the telecommunications giant “repeatedly failed” to protect consumer data. While AT&T has continued to deny wrongdoing, it opted to settle earlier this year. “We have agreed to this settlement to avoid the expense and uncertainty of protracted litigation,” AT&T said in a Thursday statement, adding that the company remains “committed to protecting our customers’ data and ensuring their continued trust in us.” Eligible consumers have until Dec. 18 to file for a settlement payment which will still need a judge’s final stamp of approval early next year. Here’s what you should know. What data breaches does the AT&T settlement cover? The settlement covers two different breaches. Both were disclosed in 2024 but involve data belonging to millions of current and former AT&T customers dating as far back as 2019 or earlier. AT&T disclosed the first of these breaches in March 2024, after the company said it found that customer information from 2019 or earlier had been released on the “dark web” weeks earlier. At the time, AT&T said the breach impacted roughly 7. 6 million current and 65. 4 million former account holders with leaked data including some sensitive info like Social Security numbers and passcodes. The other breach involved call and text records of nearly all AT&T customers from May through October of 2022, as well as a small subset from Jan. 2, 2023. AT&T said it learned that data was “illegally downloaded from our workspace on a third-party cloud platform” in April of last year and began notifying customers in July 2024, after launching an investigation. The company maintained that the leaked records included information like phone numbers, but not content of the calls or texts, or other personally identifiable information. Several lawsuits emerged over both of these data breaches which were later consolidated. The settlement was reached earlier this year in U. S. District Court in Texas. How much money could impacted customers get? The settlement’s cash funds total $177 million to pay those impacted by both of these breaches which divvies up to $149 million for the first “settlement class” and another $28 million for the second, per a preliminary approval order filed in June. According to the settlement administrator’s website, consumers impacted by the first breach may be eligible to up to $5,000. And those affected by the second breach may be eligible for up to $2,500. It’s also possible to be an “overlap settlement class member,” which would mean you may be eligible for payments from both of these funds. Final payment amounts will vary depending on losses documented from each person as well as the total number of claims received and added costs like attorney fees. And the court still has to give the settlement its final stamp of approval, in a hearing currently scheduled for Jan. 15, 2026. When is the deadline to file a claim? In the meantime, consumers have a little over a month left to file a claim online or by mail. The deadline is Dec. 18. To learn more, you can visit the website of the settlement administrator, Kroll Settlement Administration. Class members can also opt-out or make an objection before Nov. 17.",2025-11-14T09:11:53,False,False,True,False,False,False

According to Dell, attackers with low privileges can use the installation program to upgrade their access rights, which the manufacturer announced in a warning message. Where is the problem? The security vulnerability is located in the installer for Dell’s utility app that users can use to manage keyboards, webcams, and other peripheral devices. The vulnerability allows an attacker with limited rights to obtain higher system rights through a targeted attack. Dell confirms that all versions of DDPM prior to 2.1.2.12 are affected. Version 2.1.2.12 is the first release to address the problem. Who’s affected? What should they do? Windows PCs that have the Dell Display and Peripheral Manager (DDPM) installed are affected. That typically means Dell business systems or users who manage peripherals via Dell’s tool, which presumably includes millions of PC users around the world. Anyone using the program should update to the latest version ASAP or deactivate the tool until the update is installed. According to initial assessment, the vulnerability is currently not being exploited in the wild. Nevertheless, Dell advises users to update quickly, as the program is likely to be installed by default on many Windows PCs. High-risk case with quick fix The fact that Dell categorizes the vulnerability as “high impact” and at the same time publishes a quick fix shows how dramatic the case is. It’s especially risky in corporate environments where Dell peripherals are widely used. An attack can have significant consequences there. If you want to be on the safe side, temporarily deactivate the DDPM tool and install the update before attackers gets a chance.",2025-11-12T16:06:56,False,False,False,True,False,True

Bronkhorst Tue, 11/11/2025 12: 00 NEW YORK Cybersecurity experts are warning that artificial intelligence agents, widely considered the next frontier in the generative AI revolution, could wind up getting hijacked and doing the dirty work for hackers. AI agents are programs that use artificial intelligence chatbots to do the work humans do online, like buy a plane ticket or add events to a calendar. But the ability to order around AI agents with plain language makes it possible for even the technically non-proficient to do mischief.""We're entering an era where cybersecurity is no longer about protecting users from bad actors with a highly technical skillset,"" AI startup Perplexity said in a blog post.""For the first time in decades, we're seeing new and novel attack vectors that can come from anywhere.""These so-called injection attacks are not new in the hacker world, but previously required cleverly written and concealed computer code to cause damage. But as AI tools evolved from just generating text, images or video to being ""agents"" that can independently scour the internet, the potential for them to be commandeered by prompts slipped in by hackers has grown.""People need to understand there are specific dangers using AI in the security sense,"" said software engineer Marti Jorda Roca at NeuralTrust, which specialises in large language model security. Meta calls this query injection threat a ""vulnerability."" OpenAI chief information security officer Dane Stuckey has referred to it as ""an unresolved security issue.""Both companies are pouring billions of dollars into AI, the use of which is ramping up rapidly along with its capabilities.- AI 'off track' -Query injection can in some cases take place in real time when a user prompt -- ""book me a hotel reservation"" -- is gerrymandered by a hostile actor into something else -- ""wire $100 to this account.""But these nefarious prompts can also be hiding out on the internet as AI agents built into browsers encounter online data of dubious quality or origin, and potentially booby-trapped with hidden commands from hackers. Eli Smadja of Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point sees query injection as the ""number one security problem"" for large language models that power AI agents and assistants that are fast emerging from the ChatGPT revolution. Major rivals in the AI industry have installed defenses and published recommendations to thwart such cyberattacks. Microsoft has integrated a tool to detect malicious commands based on factors, including where instructions for AI agents originate. OpenAI alerts users when agents doing their bidding visit sensitive websites and blocks proceeding until the software is supervised in real time by the human user. Some security professionals suggest requiring AI agents to get user approval before performing any important task like exporting data or accessing bank accounts.""One huge mistake that I see happening a lot is to give the same AI agent all the power to do everything,"" Smadja told AFP. In the eyes of cybersecurity researcher Johann Rehberger, known in the industry as ""wunderwuzzi,"" the biggest challenge is that attacks are rapidly improving.""They only get better,"" Rehberger said of hacker tactics. Part of the challenge, according to the researcher, is striking a balance between security and ease of use since people want the convenience of AI doing things for them without constant checks and monitoring. Rehberger argues that AI agents are not mature enough to be trusted yet with important missions or data.""I don't think we are in a position where you can have an agentic AI go off for a long time and safely do a certain task,"" the researcher said.""It just goes off track.""by Thomas UrbainThe information contained in the article posted represents the views and opinions of the author and does not necessarily represent the views or opinions of eNCA. com.",2025-11-11T10:00:00,False,False,False,True,True,True

According to court records, the Russian acted as the initial access broker for the Yanluowang ransomware group while being a resident in Russia from July 2021 to November 2022. Prosecutors accused Volkov and several unnamed co-conspirators of attacking seven United States businesses during that period, adding that at least two of the United States businesses paid a combined $1. 5 million in ransoms. In the court records, prosecutors claimed that victims of the ransomware group included an engineering firm and a bank. They claimed that executives of these firms received harassing phone calls after their networks were hit with distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. The Yanluowang ransomware group was fingered for the operation, with the prosecutors noting that they stole data belonging to the firms and encrypted it to extort money.

SK Telecom took the first decisive action on Thursday, appointing Chief Governance Officer Jung Jai-hun as the new CEO, replacing Ryu Young-sang, who had served since 2021. The company’s leadership change accompanied the release of its third-quarter earnings, which revealed its first-ever operating loss since quarterly reporting began in 2000. It reported an operating loss of 52. 2 billion won ($36. 5 million), with revenue sliding 16. 8 percent year-on-year to 2. 66 trillion won. The company also suspended its third-quarter dividend. The financial setback was primarily due to sizable one-off costs from the massive hacking incident that leaked the information records of nearly 27 million users. The costs included around 500 billion won in customer compensation and contract cancellation fee waivers, and a 134. 8 billion won fine from the Personal Informatio.",2025-11-03T08:02:02,False,False,False,False,True,False

CISA issues Linux ransomware attack warning. Getty Admit it: the first thing you think of when ransomware is mentioned is likely Microsoft Windows as an attack surface. The second might be that ransomware is in decline and no longer a significant threat. The thought that Linux could be caught somewhere in all this probably doesn’t enter your head, but it should. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has issued a timely reminder that Linux can be exploited, as it warns federal agencies to update within days, following confirmation of a Linux vulnerability being used in active ransomware attacks. Here’s what you need to know. ForbesLinkedIn DM Attack Warning What Users Need To KnowBy Davey Winder Linux Kernel Vulnerability Exploited By Ransomware Attackers The CVE-2024-1086 Linux Kernel use-after-free vulnerability “allows a normal user to become an administrator (root), allowing them to change files, disable security, or install malware,” Immersive Security said, adding that “the flaw occurs when the system mishandles memory, allowing attackers to gain complete system control. But that was, checks date, almost two years ago. Indeed, the thing was fixed in January 2024. So, what’s the fuss all of a sudden? Self-described America’s Security Agency, CISA, has issued a binding directive and warning that ransomware threat actors are actively exploiting CVE-2024-1086, giving federal agencies until November 20 to apply the necessary fix or “discontinue use of the product.” But this isn’t a warning just for those federal agencies, it’s one that all businesses need to take note of. The cost of not doing so could be high as ransomware groups look to exploit this old vulnerability in “certain older versions of the Linux operating system,” as Immersive put it.

This potential security breach underscores the volatility of cyber threats that could compromise sensitive government information. As the situation evolves, cybersecurity experts and federal agencies are working around the clock to assess the scope and impact of the breach. Details of the Potential Breach The breach was initially detected by a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) monitoring system designed for persistent cyber threat surveillance. Although specifics regarding the breach origin are not yet disclosed, preliminary investigations suggest that it may involve an unidentified foreign actor, highlighting the increasing sophistication of global cyber espionage. The alert, categorized as high-priority, urges all federal agencies to reevaluate their cybersecurity protocols and initiate immediate countermeasures to bolster defenses. This incident once again signifies the emphatic need for robust and resilient cybersecurity infrastructures within federal departments. Potential Implications Data Compromise: There is an inherent risk of classified information being accessed by unauthorized entities. Such breaches can potentially expose government strategies, proprietary data, and personal citizen information. Operational Disruption: Cyberattacks may lead to disruptions within essential government operations, which can have cascading effects on national security and public services. International Relations: A possible attribution of the attack to a foreign entity could strain diplomatic relations and instigate geopolitical tensions. Response and Mitigation Strategies In response to the alert, federal agencies are being advised to follow a multi-faceted approach towards mitigation, involving immediate and long-term strategies: Immediate Response Protocols Enforce a temporary shutdown of vulnerable systems to contain the breach and prevent further unauthorized access. Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify the breach's origin and evaluate compromised systems. Strengthen perimeter defenses by updating firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems. Implement heightened network monitoring and alert systems for early threat detection and response. Long-term Cybersecurity Enhancements Continuous Security Training: Conduct regular cybersecurity awareness sessions for employees to recognize and avoid phishing or social engineering attacks. Advanced Threat Intelligence: Develop capabilities to forecast potential threat vectors and prepare proactive defenses by employing AI-driven threat intelligence solutions. Enhanced Collaboration: Encourage inter-agency and international collaborations to share threat intelligence and jointly devise counter-strategies. Regulatory Compliance: Ensure strict adherence to cybersecurity frameworks like NIST and GDPR, enhancing accountability and systemic protection. The Critical Role of Cybersecurity in Government In today’s increasingly digital world, the importance of cybersecurity cannot be overstated, especially within federal agencies that handle trillions of dollars in transactions and sensitive proprietary information. Cybersecurity serves not only as a shield against potential breaches but also as a pillar supporting public trust in governance. Recent attacks, such as the SolarWinds breach, have shown that potential national security threats can arise not just from physical spaces but within digital horizons. Establishing a fortified cyber defense program is crucial for sustaining national security, public safety, and economic stability. Conclusion The current cybersecurity incident serves as an urgent reminder for federal agencies to reassess and reinforce their cybersecurity measures, preparing for a future where cyber threats will likely multiply in complexity and regularity. While this alert sends shockwaves across government corridors, it also provides an opportunity to foster innovation and collaboration in cybersecurity practices. The road ahead requires a proactive stance and strategic foresight in fortifying our defenses against the hidden adversaries of the cyber realm. Ultimately, this potential breach propels an imperative movement towards a secure digital infrastructure that protects the boundaries of governmental operations and by extension, national welfare. Stay vigilant, informed, and prepared the cybersecurity landscape is constantly evolving, and so must we.

I think you'll agree that this is pretty much the exact opposite of online security. Amongst the leaked information was personal information, including partial credit card details, messages to customer support agents and, with the need to diagnose and manually verify disputed age checks, government ID images. No full payment details or user login details were affected. The attack on Discord didn't affect the company's main servers and infrastructure, but instead targeted a third-party customer support service. This is a particularly common avenue that bad actors use to gain access to company data, by obtaining logins for external services used for internal communication and customer support. The extent of the cyber-attack is in dispute, with Discord admitting to 70, 000 government IDs being leaked, but the hacker group that has claimed responsibility say that they had access for 58 hours by compromising the account of a support agent at an outsourced provider. This let them download 1. 5TB of sensitive data that includes over 2. 1 million government IDs. Discord disputes these figures, telling the BBC that these numbers were inflated and ""part of an attempt to extort payment"". While Discord did not name the third party service, the hackers said that it was the Zendesk portal that was affected. Speaking to the BBC, Zendesk said that its systems were not compromised through a vulnerability within its platform. Discord is still in the process of investigating the attack and working with law enforcement, and they are getting in touch with affected users. They state: ""If you were impacted, you will receive an email from noreply@discord. com. com."" So. remind me again why successive UK governments decided to not only pass online age verification laws, but also not take a hands on approach to securely implement an anonymised form of this?

And, those eligible will need specific information in order to meet claim eligibility. According to the settlement administrator website, AT&T has agreed to create two different settlement funds that will be used for payouts to class members. In some cases, class members are part of both settlements, which could increase the amount to as high as $7,500. As the claim deadline approaches, here's what to know. How to file a claim in the AT&T settlement Eligible class members must complete and submit a claim form online. According to the form, those filing a claim must either provide a class member ID, email address, AT&T account number or full name in order to login and start the process. ""In order to submit a claim online, please provide the Class Member ID found on the email or postcard notice you received, as well as the account number, email address, or name associated with your email account,"" the site said. When is the claim deadline? The preliminary approval order from the judge said notifications will begin on Aug. 4 and continue through Oct. 17. The deadline to submit a claim will be on Nov. 18 and a final approval hearing will be held on Dec. 3. AT&T has not admitted any wrongdoing associated with the breaches, but did agree to the class-action settlements. How to know if you are part of the class action settlement According to the settlement website, email notices were sent to eligible class members, from the email address attsettlement@e. emailksa. com, which contain information about the suit. The settlement website also said the following people are part of the settlement, which is split into two classes: AT&T 1 Settlement Class: Any person living in the U. S. whose data elements were included in the AT&T 1 Data Incident that was announced on March 30, 2024. Those elements include some combination of names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, account passcodes, billing account numbers, and Social Security numbers. AT&T 2 Settlement Class: Any AT&T account owner, or line or end user whose AT&T 2 Data Elements were involved in the AT&T 2 Data Incident that was announced on or about July 12, 2024. Those elements include means telephone numbers of current and former AT&T customers, counts of those interactions, aggregate call durations for a day or month and more. Some people are in both settlement classes, the administrator said. Customers impacted by the hacks were contacted by text, email or U. S. mail, the company said. Those with active AT&T accounts were also told to check their accounts online. Prior customers who had service at some point between May 2022 and Nov. 22 should have received a notification with an account and case number if they were affected. How much money could you get? Details on how much money customers could get are dependent on the number of claims filed. Those involved in a breach from 2019 could receive up to $5,000, depending on documentation of provided losses. Those in the 2024 incident could receive up to $2,500. Those part of both classes could get up to $7,500. Why is there a class-action settlement? The first incident was announced in March 2024, involving data as far back as 2019. At that time, AT&T said it discovered data had been released on the dark web, including social security numbers and passcodes for more than 7 million customers and more than 60 million former customers. Months later, the company revealed a second data breach. That security incident compromised the data of ""nearly all"" AT&T cellular network customers, with hackers stealing six months worth of call and text message records, the company said. The breach also impacted AT&T landline customers that interacted with affected cellular numbers, the company said. According to NBC News, the company said in an SEC filing that it learned from an internal investigation hackers had ""unlawfully accessed and copied AT&T call logs"" that were saved on a third-party cloud platform. The investigation revealed that compromised data included phone and text message records of ""nearly all"" AT&T customers from May 1, 2022 to Oct. 31, 2022, as well as Jan. 2, 2023. The data does not contain the content of calls or texts, personal information such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or other personally identifiable information, AT&T said at the time. The compromised data also did not include some information typically seen in usage details, such as the time stamp of calls or texts, the company said.",2025-10-09T12:45:02,False,False,True,False,True,False

487060a0-6650-492e-9085-d6ae54b8a505,Inside Oracle's zero-day chaos: how Clop rewrote the ransomware rulebook,PCQuest,https://www.pcquest.com/security-products/inside-oracles-zero-day-chaos-how-clop-rewrote-the-ransomware-rulebook-10541001,"In August 2023 a zero day was dropped by one of the most functional ransomware gangs and wasand was unknown to most, including security researchers and journalists. CVE-2023-21839, a vulnerability in Oracle WebLogic Server, wasn’t getting any publicity until it was too late. But the Clop ransomware gang was already exploiting this in various technical writings that went largely unnoticed. No malware, no encryption, just surgical data theft. This wasn’t a new exploit, but a paradigm shift. If you’re still thinking about this vulnerability in terms of your firewall alerts and EDR alerts, you’re playing the wrong game. So what is CVE-2023-21839? It’s a remote unauthenticated vulnerability in Oracle’s WebLogic Server, which is still being used by thousands of large enterprises as a legacy platform. The vulnerability lives in the T3 protocol, which WebLogic nodes use to communicate. An attacker sends a T3 packet. The server receives it like a legitimate handshake and hands over access at the SYSTEM level without asking for credentials. No end-user click, no end-user phishing, and no end-user interaction. If this doesn’t give you the chills, it should. Why Clop pounced, and how they did it Clop didn’t make a big scene. This is the first indicator it wasn’t a benign operation, meaning they weren’t calling a ransomware payload. Instead, it was just straight access. When they found exposed WebLogic instances (and there were many), they could: - Use the zero-day for unauthenticated remote control. - deploy lightweight tooling to do internal recon and data harvesting - exfiltrate company data: contracts, HR files, and financials - Then slip away quietly and come back later with a ransom note. The end result? Pay, or your data gets published. Now this is the modern ransomware model. It’s not about the actual harm they cause. It’s about using your data to extort a ransom. WebLogic: legacy tech, wide attack surface Let’s be real, WebLogic is old. And it’s done well for itself because it just works. Java-heavy environments, specifically government, higher education, and finance, have been using it for years. Many WebLogic instances were never segmented properly. Some hadn’t been patched in nearly 5 years. When you look at this from a hacker’s perspective, WebLogic is the perfect target: - often exposed to the internet with dev/admin access - in semi-trusted network zones - or popping up for backend connections to databases, storage, and internal APIs If you want to move laterally in a corporate network without being detected, this is your No ransomware? That’s the point Clop has perfected what’s now called ""data-only extortion."" And it works better than old-school encryption attacks. Why skip the locker? It’s less noisy. It’s harder to detect. There’s no recovery from a public leak; backups can’t help you. Victims don’t fear downtime. They fear regulators, shareholders, and headlines. So when Clop threatens to leak terabytes of sensitive internal documents, people pay. This strategy isn’t new, but it’s reaching a new level of refinement. With zero-days like this in their arsenal, ransomware groups no longer need a payload. The exploit is the weapon. How it evades detection Traditional security tools fail here, and that’s by design. T3 protocol? Most firewalls and IDS/IPS solutions don’t inspect it. No malware? EDR tools see nothing. Native tool execution (PowerShell, Certutil)? Looks like admin behavior. Data exfil over HTTPS? Hides in plain sight. By the time a defender notices something’s off, like unexpected outbound traffic or a strange admin user, it’s already post-exfil. And the ransom email has arrived. What defenders should be doing now If you’re still running WebLogic, assume compromise. Don’t hope. Don’t delay. Act. Start here: Patch now. Oracle fixed the bug in its October 2023 CPU. If you haven’t applied it yet, stop reading and do that. Audit internet-exposed services. Anything WebLogic-related should be behind a reverse proxy or VPN, never direct. Segment aggressively. Middleware servers don’t need access to everything. Enable deep inspection of T3/T3S protocol streams at your edge firewall (if supported). Hunt for indicators, especially: Creation of unknown WebLogic users Suspicious outbound connections Unscheduled execution of Java or native scripts Even better, simulate this exact scenario in a red team exercise. See how long it takes your SOC to respond. That’s your real exposure window. The bigger shift: this won’t be the last time Clop is not done. Neither are the other ransomware gangs watching and learning. The model works: find a zero-day, use it to get in, take everything, and extract money from the victim privately. It’s working. It’s scalable. And it’s hard to track. So don’t think this is going to be limited to Oracle. This same play can target: • VPNs • Web portals • IoT gateways • API endpoints The surface area is huge. They’re already scanning. Final thoughts: breach is the new normal This exploit isn’t an outlier, it’s just an opportunity to see how modern cybercriminals really work. They no longer have to initiate or focus on encrypting your servers as the way to hurt you. The model is shifting to quietly extract what matters (contracts, source code, customer lists, internal chats) and watch you panic. If you have a security posture that’s still based on signature-based detection, you’re already behind. If your response approach doesn’t include monitoring or responding to malware when it’s not present and looting is happening, you’re blind to half the threat horizon. You need to change your mindset. Assume breach. Detect faster. Respond smarter. Because the hackers already have.

Instead, they dismantled a clandestine telecommunications hub that investigators say was capable of crippling cellular networks and concealing hostile communications. According to federal officials, the operation seized more than 300 devices tied to roughly 100, 000 SIM cards an arsenal of network-manipulating tools that could disrupt the cellular backbone of New York City at a moment of geopolitical tension. The discovery, officials stressed, was not just a one-off bust but a warning sign of a much broader national security vulnerability. The devices were designed to create what experts call a “SIM farm,” an industrial-scale operation where hundreds or thousands of SIM cards can be manipulated simultaneously. These setups are typically associated with financial fraud or bulk messaging scams. Still, the Secret Service warned that they can also be used to flood telecom networks, disable cell towers, and obscure the origin of communications. In the shadow of the UN, where global leaders convene and security tensions are high, the proximity of such a system raised immediate questions about intent, attribution, and preparedness.“(SIM farms) could jam cell and text services, block emergency calls, target first responders with fake messages, spread disinformation, or steal login codes,” Jake Braun, Executive Director of the Cyber Policy Initiative at the University of Chicago and former White House Acting Principal Deputy National Cyber Director, tells The Cipher Brief. “In short, they could cripple communications just when they’re needed most.”Sign up for the Cyber Initiatives Group Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day directly to your inbox. Sign up for the CIG newsletter today. How SIM Farms WorkAt their core, SIM farms exploit the fundamental architecture of mobile networks. Each SIM card represents a unique identity on the global communications grid. By cycling through SIMs at high speed, operators can generate massive volumes of calls, texts, or data requests that overwhelm cellular infrastructure. Such floods can mimic the effects of a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, except the assault comes through legitimate carrier channels rather than obvious malicious traffic.“SIM farms are essentially racks of modems that cycle through thousands of SIM cards,” Dave Chronister, CEO of Parameter Security, tells The Cipher Brief. “Operators constantly swap SIM cards and device identifiers so traffic appears spread out rather than coming from a single source.”That makes them extremely difficult to detect.“They can mimic legitimate business texts and calls, hide behind residential internet connections, or scatter equipment across ordinary locations so there’s no single, obvious signal to flag,” Chronister continued. “Because SIM farms make it hard to tie a number back to a real person, they’re useful to drug cartels, human-trafficking rings and other organized crime, and the same concealment features could also be attractive to terrorists.”That ability to blend in, experts highlight, is what makes SIM farms more than just a criminal nuisance. While SIM farms may initially be used for financial fraud, their architecture can be easily repurposed for coordinated cyber-physical attacks. That dual-use nature makes them especially appealing to both transnational criminal groups and state-backed intelligence services. Who Might Be Behind It? The Secret Service, however, has not publicly attributed the network near the UN to any specific individual or entity. Investigators are weighing several possibilities: a transnational fraud ring exploiting the chaos of UN week to run large-scale scams, or a more concerning scenario where a state-backed group positioned the SIM farm as a contingency tool for disrupting communications in New York. Officials noted that the operation’s sophistication suggested it was not a low-level criminal endeavor. The hardware was capable of sustained operations against multiple carriers, and its sheer scale 100, 000 SIM cards far exceeded the typical scale of fraud schemes. That raised the specter of hostile governments probing U. S. vulnerabilities ahead of potential hybrid conflict scenarios. Analysts note that Russia, China, and Iran have all been implicated in blending criminal infrastructure with state-directed cyber operations. Yet, these setups serve both criminals and nation-states, and attribution requires more details than are publicly available.“Criminal groups use SIM farms to make money with scams and spam,” said Braun. “State actors can use them on a bigger scale to spy, spread disinformation, or disrupt communications and sometimes they piggyback on criminal networks.”One source in the U. S. intelligence community, who spoke on background, described that overlap as “hybrid infrastructure by design.”“It can sit dormant as a criminal enterprise for years until a foreign government needs it. That’s what makes it so insidious,” the source tells The Cipher Brief. From Chronister’s purview, the “likely explanation is that it’s a sophisticated criminal enterprise.”“SIM-farm infrastructure is commonly run for profit and can be rented or resold. However, the criminal ecosystem is fluid: nation-states, terrorist groups, or hybrid actors can and do co-opt criminal capabilities when it suits them, and some state-linked groups cultivate close ties with criminal networks,” he said. The Broader National Security Blind SpotThe incident during the United Nations General Assembly also underscores a growing blind spot in U. S. protective intelligence: telecommunications networks as contested terrain. For decades, federal resources have focused heavily on cybersecurity, counterterrorism, and physical threats. At the same time, the connective tissue of modern communications has often been treated as a commercial domain, monitored by carriers rather than security agencies. The Midtown bust suggests that assumption no longer holds. The Secret Service itself framed the incident as a wake-up call.“The potential for disruption to our country’s telecommunications posed by this network of devices cannot be overstated,” stated U. S. Secret Service Director Sean Curran. “The U. S. Secret Service’s protective mission is all about prevention, and this investigation makes it clear to potential bad actors that imminent threats to our protectees will be immediately investigated, tracked down and dismantled.”However, experts warn that U. S. defenses remain fragmented. Carriers focus on fraud prevention, intelligence agencies monitor foreign adversaries, and law enforcement investigates domestic crime. The seams between those missions are precisely where SIM farms thrive. The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Hybrid Warfare and the Next Front LineThe rise of SIM farms reflects the evolution of hybrid warfare, where the boundary between criminal activity and state action blurs, and adversaries exploit commercial infrastructure as a means of attack. Just as ransomware gangs can moonlight as proxies for hostile intelligence services, telecom fraud networks may double as latent disruption tools for foreign adversaries. Additionally, the threat mirrors patterns observed abroad. In Ukraine, officials have reported Russian operations targeting cellular networks to disrupt battlefield communications and sow panic among civilians. In parts of Africa and Southeast Asia, SIM farms have been linked to both organized crime syndicates and intelligence-linked influence campaigns. That same playbook, experts caution, could be devastating if applied in the heart of a global city.“If activated during a crisis, such networks could flood phone lines, including 911 and embassy hotlines, to sow confusion and delay coordination. They can also blast fake alerts or disinformation to trigger panic or misdirect first responders, making it much harder for authorities to manage an already volatile situation,” Chronister said. “Because these setups are relatively cheap and scalable, they are an inexpensive but effective way to complicate emergency response, government decision-making, and even protective details.”Looking AheadThe dismantling of the clandestine telecom network in New York may have prevented an imminent crisis, but experts caution that it is unlikely to be the last of its kind. SIM farms are inexpensive to set up, scalable across borders, and often hidden in plain sight. They represent a convergence of cyber, criminal, and national security threats that the U. S. is only beginning to treat as a unified challenge. When it comes to what needs to be done next, Braun emphasized the importance of “improving information sharing between carriers and government, investing in better tools to spot hidden farms, and moving away from SMS for sensitive logins.”“Treat SIM farms as a national security threat, not just telecom fraud. Limit access to SIM farm hardware and punish abuse. Help smaller carriers strengthen defenses,” he continued. “And streamline legal steps so takedowns happen faster.”Chronister acknowledged that while “carriers are much better than they were five or ten years ago, as they’ve invested in spam filtering and fraud analytics, attackers can still get through when they rotate SIMs quickly, use eSIM provisioning, or spread activity across jurisdictions.”“Law enforcement and intelligence have powerful tools, but legal, technical, and cross-border constraints mean detection often outpaces confident attribution and rapid takedown. Make it harder to buy and cycle through SIMs in bulk and strengthen identity verification for phone numbers,” he added. “Require faster, real-time information-sharing between carriers and government during traffic spikes, improve authentication for public alerts, and run regular stress-tests and red-team exercises against telecom infrastructure. Finally, build joint takedown and mutual-assistance arrangements with allies so attackers can’t simply reconstitute operations in another country.”Are you Subscribed to The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel on YouTube?

Yet Britain seems remarkably ill-preparedThe cause isnt clear, but the impact has already been devastating. More than a month has passed since Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) was targeted in a cyber-attack that forced the car manufacturer to turn off computers and shut factories. Peter Kyle, the business secretary, last week claimed Labour had taken decisive action to support JLRs supply chain, but the governments promise to guarantee part of a 1. 5bn commercial loan looked more like an attempt to weather the party conference than an act of genuine support. The firm will survive. It made pre-tax profits of 2. 5bn last year and has a rich owner. Its suppliers arent so lucky. The Guardian has reported that thousands of workers have already been laid off across its supply chain. JLR is paying its direct suppliers, but this money will take time to pass down to smaller firms. The sight of banks asking parts makers to put up their family homes as guarantees for emergency loans is outrageous. Small suppliers shouldnt have to take on debt to cope with a crisis for which theyre blameless.

According to Mandiant, ransomware-related intrusions accounted for 21% of observed cyber incidents last year, with the average attack costing more than AUD $7.6 million.{loadads} In response, Google is rolling out a new AI-powered defence in Google Drive for desktop designed to stop ransomware in its tracks. Unlike traditional antivirus tools, which focus on identifying malicious code before it executes, Google’s system recognises ransomware activity as it begins — specifically, attempts to encrypt or corrupt files en masse. When Drive for desktop detects suspicious patterns, it automatically halts file syncing to prevent malware from spreading to the cloud. Users are then guided through an intuitive restoration process that allows them to recover healthy file versions with just a few clicks. IT administrators receive real-time alerts via the Admin console, helping them manage threats at scale. By shifting the focus from prevention to rapid containment and recovery, Google is introducing a new model for defending against ransomware. The capability, now available in open beta, is included in most Workspace commercial plans at no additional cost, extending advanced protection to both businesses and individual users. As Bob O’Donnell of TECHnalysis Research put it, “This is great not only for Google Workspace users but individuals and companies who may use other office productivity suites as well.” {loadads}{loadmtreelistings -1}",2025-10-02T06:22:57,True,False,False,False,False,True

The malware now attacks Windows, Linux, and VMware ESXi environments simultaneously. Thanks to new obfuscation techniques, such as DLL reflection in Windows and aggressive packing, LockBit 5.0 evades known security solutions. The Linux version allows precise attacks on directories and file types via command lines. With VMware ESXi, the malware encrypts virtual machines, which can paralyze entire infrastructures. A random 16-digit file extension makes it difficult to recover encrypted data. Trend Micro explains: The existence of Windows, Linux, and ESXi variants confirms LockBit’s continued cross-platform strategy, enabling simultaneous attacks across entire enterprise networks including virtualized environments. Heavy obfuscation and technical improvements across all variants make LockBit 5.0 significantly more dangerous than its predecessors. With LockBit pursuing a cross-platform ransomware strategy, the modular architecture and covert encryption routines now threaten workstations, servers, and hypervisors (virtual machine monitors) alike. “No operating system or platform can be considered safe from modern ransomware campaigns,” emphasizes Trend Micro. Despite Operation Cronos, which took place in 2024 and saw authorities from 10 countries confiscate LockBit servers and keys, LockBit continues to show resilience. All three variants of LockBit are still active, which makes the group one of the most dangerous right now. Companies should take comprehensive measures to guard against ransomware, including regular data backups, endpoint security, and special protection of virtualization infrastructures. Ransomware damage could involve everything from data loss to critical system shutdowns.

So, up top: I dont know anyone depicted in The Hack, Jack Thornes seven-part drama about Guardian journalist Nick Daviess investigation into the scandal of the phone-hacking perpetrated by various members of Rupert Murdochs News International, which led to seven major police investigations, nearly 40 convictions and the closing of the News of the World. Ive never met Davies or the then editor of the paper, with whom the drama is almost as concerned, Alan Rusbridger (beyond a handshake from on high, literally and metaphorically hes much taller than Toby Jones, who plays him here in a crowded tent at Hay-on-Wye 20 years ago). Disclaimer ends. Lets get cracking! The Hack opens in 2008, when Davies played by David Tennant with his customary tension and earnestness, which I always find distractingly effortful, though I remain aware that I am in the minority is tipped off about the News of the World hacking into the voicemails of celebrities to garner gossip and stories, with pictures and other evidence gathered after the fact to disguise the illegal source. The editor, Andy Coulson, had resigned in the wake of one rogue reporter doing so the year before. In fact, the practice is endemic. And Coulson is now director of communications for the then prime minister, David Cameron, which puts the story firmly within the public interest. Davies starts the painstaking business of stacking it up, then re-stacking as it becomes bigger and bigger and the Metropolitan polices connection sliding into complicity? cooperation? corruption? with the tabloids becomes an ever more prominent part of his discoveries over the next six years.",2025-09-24T21:00:17,False,False,False,False,True,False

This trend follows a major ransomware attack that disrupted airport check-in systems across Europe over the weekend, stranding thousands of passengers. The European Unions cybersecurity agency ENISA confirmed the hack on Collins Aerospace, owned by RTX, was a ransomware attack but did not disclose its origin. The outage affected check-in and baggage drop services, impacting dozens of flights since Friday. Rafe Pilling, Director of Threat Intelligence at British cybersecurity firm Sophos, stated that most ransomware activity still focuses on extortion through data encryption and theft. He added that a subset of attacks designed for maximum disruption, often by Western-based groups, are becoming more visible and ambitious. No group had claimed responsibility for the Collins Aerospace hack on dark web leak sites as of Monday. Ransomware is malicious software used to encrypt a companys data and demand payment for its release. Many cybercriminal groups traditionally avoid high-profile targets to escape law enforcement attention. Other groups, however, are growing more brazen in their target selection according to cybersecurity experts. In April, hackers known as Scattered Spider were widely reported behind an attack that crippled British retailer Marks & Spencer. The attack prevented the well-known retailer from taking online orders for several weeks. Britains National Crime Agency charged two teenagers last Thursday over a 2024 cyberattack on Londons Transport for London. The NCA said the TfL attack caused significant disruption and millions in losses. Investigators believe the TfL attack was carried out by members of Scattered Spider. The FBI stated Scattered Spider was involved in approximately 120 network intrusions, earning around $115 million in ransom payments. Martyn Thomas, Emeritus Professor of IT at Gresham College in London, warned the problem will likely grow until software security improves. He said cyber criminals have so far been motivated by disruption or financial gain. Thomas cautioned that the same attack strategies could target critical healthcare or infrastructure systems to cause serious harm. The pursuit of reputation within criminal circles is driving more risky attacks on high-profile targets. Cybercriminals gain online clout and social standing among peers by successfully breaching major organisations. Pilling noted a small but determined set of Western-based cybercriminals are becoming emboldened by past successes. He emphasised their motivation is not solely financial but also includes gaining credibility within their networks. Reuters.",2025-09-22T23:22:54,True,False,True,False,True,True

""We recently detected unauthorized access to a third-party service providers platform that supports our North American customer service operations,"" Stellantis said. ""Upon discovery, we immediately activated our incident response protocols, initiated a comprehensive investigation and took prompt action to contain and mitigate the situation.

A spokesperson told Engadget the automaker is ""not providing any additional information beyond our statement."" Bleeping Computer says a group called ShinyHunters claimed credit for the breach. The group told the publication it obtained more than 18 million records, containing contact details and names, from Stellantis' Salesforce instance.

Hackers on Saturday targeted check-in and boarding systems provider Collins Aerospace, owned by RTX, disrupting operations at Heathrow, Berlin Airport and in Brussels, where passengers faced long queues, cancellations and delays. Disruption had eased significantly by early Sunday despite some continuing delays, according to airport officials and data, while regulators said they were investigating the source of the cyberattack. Brussels Airport said that 45 out of 257 scheduled departing flights on Sunday were cancelled but operational adjustments had kept waiting times down. There are delays between 30 and 90 minutes, a spokesperson for the airport told Reuters, adding it was not clear yet how much longer disruptions would last. A passenger flying from Brussels said disruption had been minimal. For me, it was business as usual. For those poor souls who didnt do online check-in or have bags to check, they may be waiting a bit, he said. The disruption is the latest in a string of hacks to hit sectors from healthcare to autos. A breach at carmaker Jaguar Land Rover halted production, while another caused Marks & Spencer losses in the hundreds of millions of pounds. RTX called the incident a cyber-related disruption and said it had impacted its MUSE software, which is used by several airlines. RTX was not immediately available for comment on Sunday. Berlin Brandenburg Airport said on Sunday problems persisted but that it was working with the company to resolve the issue. A manual workaround was in place and there were currently no major delays or cancellations, it added. Heathrow said early on Sunday work was continuing to recover from the check-in system outage. It added that the vast majority of flights have continued to operate.

9c3c3808-d96b-4e57-bc59-48bd90963acb,What is ‘tariff hacking’—and can it help keep prices down?,Fast Company,https://www.fastcompany.com/91407359/what-is-tariff-hacking-and-can-it-help-keep-prices-down?partner=rss&amp;utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=rss+fastcompany&amp;utm_content=rss,"Businesses are currently facing a tariff tsunami, not to mention global economic uncertainty as the ripple effect of those tariffs impact and reverberate through the entire global supply chain, according to Forbes. Those tariffs are forcing retailers and manufacturers to rethink supply chain strategies, to develop new ways to get their products to consumers without massive price hikes, delays, and disruption. To keep costs down for their customers and lower tariff bills, businesses are turning to a business-to-business-to-consumer model, or B2B2C, as a way to handle orders, also known as ""tariff hacking,"" CNBC reported. To meet the demand, a group of companies are emerging to handle the logistics and workarounds. For items sold direct-to-consumer on a company's website, some companies are now employing a ""middleman company"" as a merchant of record, routing the product or transaction through them as a U. S. entity. That middleman buys the product, paying the U. S. tariff based on the wholesale price, and ships it to consumers on behalf of the retailer, CNBC explained. ""This not new. It's been going on forever,"" James Mohs, associate professor of accounting, finance, and taxation at the University of New Haven told Fast Company. ""Simple example: Let's say you are a Chinese company and you have a 50% tariff coming into the U. S. and you have a subsidiary in Vietnam, that has a 10% tariff. You ship it to them, and they ship it to the U. S. with a 10% tariff, and they save 40%. If you can reduce your tariff from 50% to 10%, it keeps the price of the goods relatively lower."" However, some experts have called ""tariff hacking"" a temporary fix that won't hold in the future. ""Right now, it's a short term solution,"" Mohs said. ""Hard to say if it's a long term solution, because this tariff war is in such a state of flux right now.[It's unclear] whether the U. S. government will set the tariff based on the original country of origin, or [continue] to allow the subsidiary to act as an intermediary."".",2025-09-19T20:00:00,False,False,False,False,True,False

Prosecutor Sandra Helgadottir revealed that the leaked data belongs to more than 1. 5 million private individuals, representing nearly 15% of Swedens population of 10. 6 million. She confirmed an ongoing investigation into the data breach, noting that a group called Datacarry has claimed responsibility for the attack.

New Android malware steals your money then installs ransomware,PCWorld,https://www.pcworld.com/article/2907681/beware-new-android-malware-steals-your-money-then-installs-ransomware.html,"Its a story almost as old as time: malware is wreaking havoc on Android devices again. Usually, Android malware aims to steal sensitive data and passwords in order to gain access to online accounts. Less commonly, it installs ransomware to extort large sums of money from users. A particularly dangerous malware variant that combines both techniques has now been discovered by security experts at ThreatFabric. Known as RatOn, the Trojan infiltrates an Android phone, accesses data, empties bank accounts, then locks the device to blackmail the owner. All of this sounds scary enough, but it gets worse: RatOn can act largely autonomously. This means attackers hardly need to take any action once the Trojan lands on a device. Its able to steal PINs its own, log into accounts, and transfer money until those accounts are empty. Crypto wallets are also a common target. Once theres nothing left to steal, ransomware is automatically installed on the device. The ransomware encrypts all data and denies access, allowing the attacker to send blackmail messages to the owner demanding payment in order to restore access. However, its unclear whether those affected still have the opportunity to do so at this point, as their accounts have already been emptied. Not an isolated case The researchers expressly warn against this new type of threat from combined attacks by a single malware. RatOn is not an isolated case either, as a similar approach was previously observed in August with a variant of the Hook Trojan for Android devices. These new variants show that malware attacks are still evolving and becoming more sophisticated and dangerous, and fraudsters are responding to improved security mechanisms at banks. If access to an owners accounts cant be established, the attacker can always fall back on ransomware as a plan B. How to protect yourself In the case of RatOn, the Trojan likely lands on Android devices through fake apps. Users are redirected to pages that imitate the Google Play Store, where attackers offer applications disguised as common social media apps like TikTokexcept its malware. Developers can offer applications there themselves, but they arent checked beforehand. To protect yourself, you should always check whether an app comes from a trustworthy provider. You should also always activate Google Play Protect in the Google Play Store so that apps are scanned for viruses and malware before theyre installed on your device. Also, avoid clicking on links until youve verified theyre trustworthy. Especially avoid links that supposedly lead to free versions of paid apps or promise other unrealistic offers.

Caroline Bishop Sep 09, 2025 09: 04 The Seoul Police have successfully dismantled a sophisticated international cybercrime operation, recovering 39 billion won using Chainalysis blockchain intelligence tools. In a landmark operation, the Seoul Police have dismantled one of the most sophisticated international cybercrime rings to date, recovering 39 billion won (approximately USD 30 million). This operation was facilitated by the advanced blockchain intelligence tools provided by Chainalysis, according to Chainalysis. Case Overview: A Bold International Hacking Ring The investigation began in September 2023 when the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency received a report from a local company executive about unauthorized access to their account. Initially appearing as an isolated incident, further investigations unveiled a series of similar cases by December of the same year. The perpetrators were found to have used unauthorized mobile phones registered under the victims' names to siphon funds. The cybercriminals hacked personal information and, posing as institutional employees, even approached the victims' families for further criminal activities. The methods employed by the hacking ring were described as unprecedented by Kim Kyung-hwan, the head of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency's Cyber Crime Investigation Unit. Tracing Funds with Chainalysis To obscure their tracks, the criminals converted the stolen funds into cryptocurrencies. However, this strategy was effectively countered by the Chainalysis blockchain data platform. Utilizing Chainalysis Reactor, the police unraveled the complex web of transactions, visualizing and tracing the flow of the illicit funds. The Reactor graphs played a crucial role in this investigation, demonstrating the importance of Chainalysis technology in mapping out the financial networks of the criminal organization. Despite the criminals' attempts to evade detection by converting their proceeds into cryptocurrencies, the transparency of blockchain transactions and advanced analytical tools rendered their efforts futile. The investigation extended beyond Korea, involving international.",2025-09-09T17:44:10,False,False,False,False,True,False

According to one security research firm, they’ve spotted the first example of ransomware powered and enabled by an LLM—specifically, an LLM by ChatGPT maker OpenAI. According to a blog post from ESET Research interviewing researcher Anton Cherepanov, they’ve detected a piece of malware “created by the OpenAI gpt-oss:20b model.” PromptLock, a fairly standard ransomware package, includes embedded prompts sent to the locally stored LLM. Because of the nature of LLM outputs (which create unique, non-repeated results with each prompt), it can evade detection from standardized antivirus setups, which are designed to search for specific flags. ESET elaborates in a Mastodon post, spotted by Tom’s Hardware. PromptLock uses Lua scripts to inspect files on a local system, encrypt them, and send sensitive data to a remote computer. It appears to be searching for Bitcoin information specifically, and thanks to the wide-open nature of the OpenAI model and the Ollama API, it can work on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Because gpt-oss:20b is a lightweight, open-source AI model that can run on local PC hardware, it doesn’t need to call back to more elaborate systems like ChatGPT—and as a result, it can’t be outright blocked by OpenAI itself. It’s written in Golang using Lua scripts, tools that would be familiar to anyone who’s making games in, say, Roblox. The point being that it’s possible PromptLock was created by someone with little-to-no experience in conventional programming. Though the output is variable, the prompts themselves are static, so Cherepanov says that “the current implementation does not pose a serious threat” despite its novelty. “Script kiddies are now prompt kiddies,” said one Mastodon user in reply.",2025-08-28T15:50:28,True,False,False,False,True,False

Stop using it,PCWorld,https://www.pcworld.com/article/2880477/this-analog-fix-for-digital-hacking-is-out-of-date-stop-using-it.html,"You probably live in 2025. That is, youve created online accounts for major services like utilities and finances. But a handful of people still avoid it, and usually its because they think doing so will help keep their accounts safer. It wont. If thats not you, chances are that someone close to you believes this. And its a problem. If the account owner doesnt set up and control online access, that leaves an opportunity for a hacker or scammer to do it instead. Twenty years ago, the offline approach made sense. Online security was frustratingly limited. (For example, bank passwords often set a length restriction of just ten characters. and with unlimited tries for guessing.) Other barriers made sense for staying analogyou could ban permission to online access or your financial institution may have required opening an online account in person. Nowadays, the world revolves around online access. Services fall over themselves to make setting up digital account access, and it can be done from anywhere in the world. So likewise, going online is actually the smarter, more secure choiceif you (or the analog lover youre helping) takes the following steps: Create an online account with a strong password. It will probably be much longer than youre used toI recommend at least 20 characters. If two-factor authentication is available, I recommend setting this up as well. If this is too complicated, make the password longer. Save the password somewhere secure you can access. Your best bet is a password manager. A local app like KeePassXC can help maintain a sense of control and security. If that wont work, a discreet note hidden away in the home is better that than a weak password. Leave it be. If the account supports passkeys, set up a passkey in addition to the password + 2FA combo. That way you can still log in if you lose the device with the passkey, but the passkey can be the faster, easier way of logging into the account whenever necessary. Convincing anyone wary of digital accounts can be a tall order (just ask anyone who does informal tech support for friends and family). Keep this info in your back pocket for whenever you next talk to them.",2025-08-21T13:00:00,False,False,False,False,True,False

In a blog post announcing the breach, the company said that a social engineering campaign had targeted its employees, with threat actors posing as IT or HR in order to trick employees into sharing account access or personal information. The company says that while the threat actors were able to access some information from the CRM, there is no indication of any access to customer accounts or the data within them. ""We acted quickly to cut the access and have added extra safeguards to protect against similar incidents in the future,"" the post reads. Workday says that the information gathered from the CRM consists of ""commonly available"" business contact information such as names, email addresses and phone numbers. From the sound of its blog post, the information of Workday end users was not revealed, only information from the companies it has contracts with. What is known with some certainty at this point is that Workday's CRM was breached.

The US Justice Department has authorized the seizure of more than $2. 8 million in cryptocurrency along with cash and other assets as part of a criminal case against an alleged ransomware operator. In a Thursday notice, the Justice Department said it had unsealed six warrants authorizing the seizure of $2. 8 million in crypto from a wallet controlled by Ianis Aleksandrovich Antropenko, as well as $70,000 in cash and a luxury vehicle. He has been charged with conspiring to commit computer fraud and abuse, computer fraud and abuse, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. ""As alleged in the unsealed warrants, the cryptocurrency and other assets are proceeds of (or were involved in laundering the proceeds of) ransomware activity,"" the notice reads. Those assets were laundered in various ways, including by using the cryptocurrency mixing service ChipMixer, which was taken down in a coordinated international operation in 2023. Antropenko also laundered cryptocurrency by exchanging cryptocurrency for cash and depositing the cash in structured cash deposits."" The seizure was the latest US government action involving cryptocurrency that could be used to bolster its national stockpile, set up by an executive order from US President Donald Trump in March. On Monday, the Justice Department said it had seized about $1 million in crypto from the ransomware group BlackSuit, and federal officials are seeking to lay claim to $2. 4 million in Bitcoin (BTC) seized by the Dallas FBI in April.

S. citizens). According to 404 Media's Joseph Cox, participants in an instant-messaging ""law enforcement group chat"" including ICE and U. S.

What are the Tea and TeaOnHer apps? The original Tea app launched in 2023, marketed as a women's safety tool to warn others about bad experiences with men they dated. However, it didn't go viral until July 2025, as it skyrocketed to the top three most downloaded apps on the Apple App Store. The app features anonymous forums, criminal background checks, phone number lookups, and a reverse image search tool to identify catfishers. To join, women must upload a selfie and a photo of their ID to verify their gender. In response to the women-focused app, a male version of the Tea app, TeaOnHer, launched. It quickly joined Tea at the top of the app charts. The app also allows men to anonymously share information on the women they date. However, many users of the Tea app said it can't be compared to TeaOnHer. TikToker Nina (@ninadoesthemost) pointed out that women and men were using their respective apps for different reasons. @ninadoesthemost My predictions on the Tea On Her” app. I forgot to say this: I think the app will actually divide men. All it takes is a few days of continuous use of the app, and many men will experience for themselves how scary and unhinged they can be. By September, they will become exhausted of hearing negative feedback on women from other men, and frankly, they won’t care about being accepted by each other on the app…At least, not more than they care about scratching that little itch… ♬ original sound - Ninadoesthemost ""What [women] are using the app for is to expose people who be doing [domestic violence] and maybe got a restraining order. Or maybe he's got seven kids and don't show up for any of them,"" she explained. ""[Men] are on there for a different reason. They're green flagging which girls are easy or good in bed."" Were Tea and TeaOnHer hacked? Both apps experienced major data breaches. In July, hackers accessed and leaked private messages between Tea users and their ID photos. The data was quickly downloaded and spread on the online imageboard, 4chan, according to 404 Media. On TikTok, many women lamented that their information was shared in the breach. ""I should’ve minded my business. Should’ve left that tea app aloneee,"" one commented under a video of the leaked images.

According to TechCrunch, the male version of the app began leaking driver's licenses of its users, too. Reporters were able to access the sensitive data in minutes, as the admin side of the app allowed unauthenticated users to access it. An X users explains how hackers got access, writing, ""TeaOnHer, the app meant to combat the infamous ""TeaApp"", is also a giant dumpster fire. It has been compromised.

How did TeaOnHer users react to the breach? On the subreddit r/technology, many users criticized the app's lack of security following the first breach of the original Tea app. ""Wait, so they saw what happened with the first app getting 'hacked' and decided, let's store user info in the same negligent way?"" one asked. ""Whoever owns that site, should just sell their computer and not touch them ever again,"" another said. ""Surprised guys put their finger in that light socket while their sister is still in the hospital with electrical burns,"" a third joked. Others questioned if the hack was a ""set up"" to expose men who use the app. ""Was this just a revenge project made by the original with the only intention of doxxing some men?"" one wrote on X.

S. Cybersurveillance Technology and Training to Repressive RegimesPORTLAND, OR Saudi human rights activist Loujain Alhathlouls groundbreaking lawsuit concerning spying software that enabled her imprisonment and torture can advance, a federal judge ruled in an opinion unsealed Tuesday. U. S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut of the District of Oregon ruled that Alhathlouls lawsuit against DarkMatter Group and three of its former executives can proceed on its claims under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act the first time that a human rights case like this has gone so far under this law. The judge dismissed other claims made under the Alien Tort Statute. Alhathloul is represented in the case by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the Center for Justice and Accountability, Foley Hoag, and Tonkon Torp LLP. ""This important ruling is the first to let a lawsuit filed by the victim of a foreign governments human rights abuses, enabled by U. S. spyware used to hack the victims devices, proceed in our federal courts, said EFF Civil Liberties Director David Greene. This case is particularly important at a time when transnational human rights abuses are making daily headlines, and we are eager to proceed with proving our case. Transparency in such times and circumstances is a cornerstone that enacts integrity and drives accountability as it offers the necessary information to understand our reality and act upon it. The latter presents a roadmap to a safer world, Alhathloul said. Todays judges order has become a public court document only to reinforce those rooted concepts of transparency that will one day lead to accountability. Alhathloul, 36, a nominee for the 2019 and 2020 Nobel Peace Prize, has been a powerful advocate for womens rights in Saudi Arabia for more than a decade. She was at the forefront of the public campaign advocating for womens right to drive in Saudi Arabia and has been a vocal critic of the countrys male guardianship system. The lawsuit alleges that defendants DarkMatter Group, Marc Baier, Ryan Adams, and Daniel Gericke were hired by the UAE to target Alhathloul and other perceived dissidents as part of the UAEs broader cooperation with Saudi Arabia. According to the lawsuit, the defendants used U. S. cybersurveillance technology, along with their U. S. intelligence training, to install spyware on Alhathlouls iPhone and extract data from it, including while she was in the United States and communicating with U. S. contacts. After the hack, Alhathloul was arbitrarily detained by the UAE security services and forcibly rendered to Saudi Arabia, where she was imprisoned and tortured. She is no longer in prison, but she is currently subject to an illegal travel ban and unable to leave Saudi Arabia. The case was filed in December 2021; Judge Immergut dismissed it in March 2023 with leave to amend, and the amended complaint was filed in May 2023. This Court concludes that Plaintiff has shown that her claims arise out of Defendants forum-related contacts, Judge Immergut wrote in her opinion. Defendants forum-related contacts include (1) their alleged tortious exfiltration of data from Plaintiffs iPhone while she was in the U. S. and (2) their acquisition, use, and enhancement of U. S.-created exploits from U. S. companies to create the Karma hacking tool used to accomplish their tortious conduct. Plaintiffs CFAA claims arise out of these U. S. contacts.

In response, a forum post attributed to EAs anti-cheat team has played up successes in tracking and catching the betas cheaters, whose crimes allegedly range from classic wallhacks, speed hacks, and aimbots to cheats that reduce recoil or display enemy health and weapon info. However, it also concedes that Secure Boot ""is not, and was not intended to be a silver bullet"" and in doing so, highlights the immense, perhaps impossible task that developers have of keeping cheater users out of their games.

Ransomware group Embargo has been accused of moving more than $34 million in several crypto-linked payments since April 2024. According to blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs, the group, which is still relatively new, has become a key player in the underground cybercrime world. TRM Labs revealed that Embargo operates under a ransomware-as-a-service model, hitting critical infrastructures across the United States. The report revealed that the group has hit hospitals and several pharmaceutical networks in numerous states. Some of its victims include American Associated Pharmacies, Georgia-based Memorial Hospital and Manor, and Weiser Hospital in Idaho, noting that the ransom demands have reached upwards of $1.3 million. TRM Labs investigations uncover Embargo’s operations According to TRM Labs, its investigations uncovered that the group might have sprang up as a rebranded version of the infamous BlackCat (ALPHV) operation. The said group disappeared earlier this year after it was involved in an exit scam. An exit scam is a kind of rug pull where individuals in charge of a project disappear with user funds without any traces. Using the Rust programming language, operating similar data leak sites, and exhibiting on-chain ties through shared wallet infrastructure, TRM Labs noted that both entities share a technical overlap. According to reports, about $18 million of illegal proceeds belonging to Embargo still lie dormant in unaffiliated wallets. Analysts believe that this tactic is used to delay detection or seek better exploit opportunities in the future. Embargo uses a network of intermediary wallets, exchanges that pose high risks, and sanctioned platforms, including Cryptos.net, to hide transaction trails and obscure funds. From May through August, TRM Labs said it traced at least $13.5 million stolen by Embargo across various virtual assets service providers, with more than $1 million moved using Cryptex alone. While Embargo does not use the aggressive tactic…",2025-08-10T11:39:33,True,False,False,False,False,True
